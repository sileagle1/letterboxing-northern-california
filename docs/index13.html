                        We've had a stamp carved and the box ready to plant for a while but

                        Hi Folks!

Princess Lea suggested I post the announcement for this gathering 
here too to make sure everyone hears about it.

We have a listing on Atlas Quest for this gathering, but am happy to...

                        Dem XXX Men and I went on a little expedition, to see if we could hop
the newly erected fence that is surrounding the site of my Art Deco
Oakland letterbox, and rescue my stamp.

Alas, the building...

                        So I have a question for everyone... I recently recently ran across a 
situation when looking for a letterbox, and I found it completely 
destroyed (in this case by wildlife). I was able to identify...

                        Might anyone be interested in seeing the Day of the Dead show at the 
Oakland Museum?  It closes this weekend, and I hear from an 
exhibitions designer that it is a really wonderful show.

                        Congratulations to Lisa and Robb who have new wheels.  What kind?  
What color?  How will we recognize you when you are breezing past us 
to the next letterbox site?

                        The slow-moving letterboxing team is slightly less slow.  We bought a 
new (to us) car, and are no longer stuck in Alameda County.

Who knows?  Maybe we'll even do some letterboxing, soon....
