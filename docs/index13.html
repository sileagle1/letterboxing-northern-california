                        Hi all,
  I know I've been exceptionally quiet of late, horrible project at work
that is finally almost done.  In my few spare moments, I notice the

                        Just wanted to know if anybody picked up my traveling letterbox, the

Hope some...

no time to get out to place it.  This past Sunday, we decided to put 
it on our "must do" list.

We ran into two problems.  First...
