I'd rather find a new box. 
    But I love to carve, so I love to make and send off HHs, plus I

About the demo event...about how many people would one 
expect if it was held in, say, Oakland on a Saturday afternoon?  I 
may have a good spot.

I am not sure what this intails, but as long as it is not a weeknight
