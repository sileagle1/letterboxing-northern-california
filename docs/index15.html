                        There will be a test on the universal letterboxing sign (don't forget 
the pengiun dance) :-) I will have balloons at our table. Camo if I 
can find them if not, green and brown. Oh I am so excited...

                        It seems that Scarab and I got our tighht-rope wires crossed, and that
Boch's Circus will not be touring Vacaville this weekend.

Sorry about that, folks!

                        I noticed that the Boch Circus Stamps have been removed from the
Vacaville Event.   What happened?  I was looking forward to seeing
some more of them.
