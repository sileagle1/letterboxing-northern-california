                        I found this link, which gives basic directions on how to use a Dremel 
to carve rubber stamps. This is the 1st time I've heard of this.

Has anyone tried it? Experience?

                        Would you be so kind as to look at my driving directions to the
Sandhill Crane Sanctuary?  I got them off the internet, and I think
they're really confusing.
