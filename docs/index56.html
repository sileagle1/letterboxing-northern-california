Hello good people,

Please cancel my vote for 1/8/05 for the carving shindig. I forgot I 
have a board meeting that day. 

You all have fun!

Our very first letterbox, the Lodi Apellation, has returned in a new 
location.  It is now the Lodi Libation and is awaiting your 
discovery.  Hope you enjoy it.

I think that I would be more inclined to make the January 8th shindig 
than NOV-DEC.  Way to much going on these 2 months, and I need all 
the  $$$$ I can get for the holidays.  Right at the moment...

Hello everyone,

I just placed my first box. It is named, "greener pastures." The 
stamp is hand carved (thanks to all of you who pointed me in the 
right direction regarding supplies!).

I hope you...
