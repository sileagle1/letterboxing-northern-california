we've been so quiet.  <br/>
<br/>
After many attempts on the Ravenclaw stamp of our Hogwarts series, it<br/>
has indeed finally gone missing (a very popular hangout for bored<br/>
teens, I'm thinking, was its cause of death).  So...we've replanted it<br/>
in what should be a much more secure area, updated the clues and map,<br/>
and it's ready to go.  <br/>
<br/>
But wait!  There's more!  We recarved all four stamps, so they are not<br/>
the crummy linoleum ones any more.  So if you couldn't get good<br/>
impressions before, ACT NOW!  <br/>
<br/>
While we were out at that lovely park, we also saw a MOLE! And a WILD<br/>
TURKEY!  And two deer, which aren't as exciting.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting.  d.a. of d.x.m.<br/>
