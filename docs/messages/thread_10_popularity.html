Don't try to deny it, Jay, you know it's true.<br>
<br>
Oops, looks like I've just outed myself as yet *another* non-Californian on <br>
the list. Lest anyone fret, my credentials to claim honorary Californian <br>
status are in order: born in Pasadena, raised in Huntington Beach, wed in <br>
Irvine...need more? <g><br>

I've been told that I have a striking resemblence to a certain <br>
governor elect.  Muscle-bound hiking powerhouse that I am.  =)<br>

Who's Angelyne?  I know an Angele, but you DEFINITELY can't be her <br>
