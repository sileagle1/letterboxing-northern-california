                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
  They moved my office at work yesterday, so I took the day off, headed<br>
south, & had a lot of fun getting most of the Lodi & Stockton area<br>
boxes.  It was the 1st time had gone out to solely hunt boxes instead of<br>
picking them up as I was on the way to somewhere.  Here's what I got:<br>
 <br>
Calaveras River Trail #1 & 2 (Watch the rocky banks, I fell flat on my<br>
butt walking down to box #1.)<br>
Alien Smorgasbord (Made myself sick sampling the junk food to make sure<br>
the aliens hadn't tainted it.)<br>
Spencer's Bone (So much duff, I looked all around the box & didn't see<br>
it for 10 minutes, almost gave up.)<br>
Able Was I Ere I Saw Elba (FF)<br>
Lakeside Lovelies #1 & 2 (Got to use my new compass for the 1st time.)<br>
Lodi Little Lamplight (Would have like to be there later to see the<br>
lamps on.)<br>
Lodi Libations (Grapes weren't getting crushed by wine press well<br>
enough, so I left an little extra weight in the box to help out.)<br>
 <br>
I tried for the Basic Bunny, but one of the park maintenence guys came<br>
driving up in his golf cart just as I was about to reach for where I<br>
thought it was & asked if I needed any help.  After that, they<br>
suspiciously watched me from the maintenence yard as I wandered around<br>
trying to look nonchalant.  I finally gave up & moved on.  It'll<br>
definately be a great place to go back to with my daughter.  I also<br>
tried for the River Retreats, but I'm pretty sure #1 has gone missing, &<br>
it was getting late, so I decided not to try for #2.  I'll send more<br>
detailed reports out the box planters shortly.  I also got to play with<br>
my new colored stamp pads & had a lot of fun making the images more<br>
interesting.  So, thanks to Grumpy Grinch, mtnbikemanns, beadgirlbecky &<br>
Da Kool Kats for putting all those boxes out there.  <br>
