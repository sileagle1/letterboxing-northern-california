Thanks for negotiating all those curves on Mt. Diablo.   We did some boxing out in Contra <br/>
Costa county, and plan to do more.  I got a peek at the stamps for the Herding Cats series <br/>
she is working on, and they will definitely be worth the 7.5 mile hike (I am waiting until <br/>
they are all planted though - only want to do that hike once!)<br/>
<br/>
Sleepy Cat and I also had some letterboxing adventures last Friday.  She hurt her leg and <br/>
was not able to walk, so we cancelled our scheduled day in Vacaville.  Instead we did <br/>
"carboxing," consisting of drive bys where I could bring the box back to the car and we <br/>
could stamp in there.  It takes slackboxing to a whole new level!  We did a 300 mile <br/>
roundtrip and managed to bag 12 finds.  The new boxes out in the Turlock/Hilmar area by <br/>
TwoRoests are quite fun and worth the drive out there.  I've been there twice now, and <br/>
every time I come back home, they've gone and planted more boxes!<br/>
<br/>
So, this period of unemployment has brought many letterboxing opportunities.  I am still <br/>
planning on getting to Vacaville some time, and am up for some group boxing - any word <br/>
on that Black Cavalier?  I am busy 1/27 and 2/3 but open other days (even weekdays).<br/>

We'd love to go boxing with you but timing it right is going to be tough. We need abougt 3 in Vacaville and the 2 new ones in Yolo (1962 something and the Bats/Vic Fazio one) but our weekends are pretty much taken up through the 11th of Feb. When you get a date in mind, let us know and we'll see. We can offer you a rest stop or sleep over here maybe if nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
You need to see the California Seal site! A unique opportunity to find your own box! John works right across the street from it 2 days a week so if you're up here on a weekday, maybe that would work.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know.<br/>
