<br/>
Ma-Ki-La<br/>
Pomo Hummingbird (at new location)<br/>
Four Seasons (4 boxes)<br/>
Paradise Ridge Oaks   Interesting sculpture garden.  Sorry that we<br/>
missed Healdsburg Amadeus and her grandson.<br/>
Twine Country box #2.   Box #1 has succumbed to a landscaping redo.<br/>
Optical Illusions Series (4 boxes)  Beautiful trees along this short hike.<br/>
Little Shop of Horrors<br/>
Sea Creatures Series (4)   Was looking forward to the restrooms at box<br/>
#3, but they were closed!!<br/>
Birds #2<br/>
The Deers of West Dartmoor   A magnificent rock and a beautiful view<br/>
of the sunset.<br/>
We also picked up 2 more HH to bring us to a grand total of 19 images.<br/>
<br/>
We'll have to wait until much cooler weather to try for Dudley's Been<br/>
Kidnapped and Tooth Fairy et al which were part of our original goal,<br/>
but we will return for these boxes!!<br/>
<br/>
Keep boxing, even though you know you will never get them all.<br/>
