                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was looking through the googlesphere for thoughts on creativity by  famous creative people. What a boring place. It's like the difference  between being in love and talking about it (unless you're very, very  talented). So I will leave them behind and speak to and from what I  experienced yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
  I didn't get home to Tahoe until midnight, and I was still wired from  the drive, so I pulled out my 'Zine and read it cover to cover. If you  haven't done that yet, do it now! OMG, it's funnier than a month of  Sunday comics (which isn't saying much, based on recent performance,  but let's say it was a good month). The creators (Hunter, did you do  this alone?) of this little gem sprinkled it with very funny visual  bits--do you know how to "sign" letterboxing?--, and written good  stuff--the movie reviews!!!!!!--, and got our clues all in one place (a  rare occurrence for me), but the boxers who took the time to complete  their questionnaires had some gems, as well. Asked to describe herself  in four words, Lisascenic wrote, "usually covered in paint." No wonder  she dressed so nicely for the event. Zairabear, in response to being  asked the most common statement made while letterboxing, wrote, "there  it is, nope not it". That cracks me up. Pretty close to home, actually.  And I really enjoyed learning that Princess Lea probably really DOES  have a homeland security file, and that Sierra Sally spent  life-changing time in India and Nepal.<br/>
<br/>
  There were so many amazing efforts of creativity and generosity made  for the day. The boxes were terrific (personal favorites Bay Bass &amp;  Who Knew?--yes, I had help), the extras ingenious--Robb, did you have  us find a specific other person for Say Cheese to get us together and  provide a red herring? you can be in charge of my party games ANY day--  &amp; I worked on Boggle last night, too, but my letters didn't line up  very advantageously. But they were very beautiful. I think that one is  worth trying again. All the efforts made for the food (above &amp;  beyond, GGs), and the space and the day (and thanks to the party next  door for the music)--thanks so much to Eclipse and Kathy for taking  this on--and personal thanks to Davis and Sac boxers for toting me to  and from Oakland. And the Circus!!! That could be a gathering all on  its own. Good call, Mim. Now I have to carve a circus stamp or two...<br/>
<br/>
  I was busy carving at the last minute and didn't get to fill out my  questionnaire, so I wanted to say a couple of personal things to a  group that has become important to me in the past almost two years. I  was raised by creative parents in a chaotic (not in a good way) home  environment that was always changing location. I don't know how much  those circumstances contributed to who I am today--because I really  believe a big part of who we are and become is set from the beginning  (the old nature vs nurture argument)-- but part of that was a huge need  to be in control, which also translated to a very controlled artistic  style. A perfectionist from way back, I have spent much of my adult  life trying to master the art of letting go. (Jumping out of a plane a  few times can help that project.) Letterboxing has been great for me on  so many levels, but one of the major ones is that it keeps me drawing  (not for stamps, but when I am out in the world and draw where I box),  and drawing more freely and non-judgementally than in the studio. Of  course, there's always that need to please, to "do good" and get that  pat on the back, but a big part of wanting to create a beautiful event  stamp was to be able to give something special to all of you who have  given me so much.<br/>
<br/>
  I don't want you to look at that stamp and think that I am anything  other than another person with her own insecurities, excitements,  goals, problems, successes, daily challenges and abundant blessings,  much like all of you. I am inspired by what I find beautiful, but also  by the amazing and wonderful feats, large and small, that are  accomplished by my fellow human beings, and letterboxers. When I need  to laugh and look at things a little differently, I will bring to mind  Javalord's exclamation, "Oh look! the ship is moving and the land is  staying still! That makes so much more sense!" I missed his explanation  of what went through his mind just before, that brought it on, but I  think it must have been having a mind and life open to creativity and  not bounded by the strictures of traditional "reality". (By the way,  Javalord, I meant to recommend a book to you--"Lightning Bird" by Lyall  Watson.  http://www.lyallwatson.com/Watson%20text%20html%20/LIGHTNING.HTML) I  would like to keep my life open in just that way, and I thank all of  you for showing me how much fun it can be. Those who weren't there were  missed.<br/>
<br/>
  In deep admiration,<br/>
