Seeing as how I'm now retired (on disability), I have all the time in<br/>
the world... But I still have to juggle my 1,487 projects &amp; interests.<br/>
It's easier now.<br/>
<br/>
The "Cabinet" has been a major breakthrough for me, because it's<br/>
solved the problem of having so many boxes go missing in very short of<br/>
time. As much as I tried to think of the boxes as ephemeral (like<br/>
sunsets &amp; flowers), it was ultimately discouraging.<br/>
<br/>
The Curiosities are a win/win situation for both me and the hosting<br/>
stores -- the store's owners love the idea &amp; it's one way of<br/>
recognizing the little business owner in a fun, creative way. <br/>
<br/>
There will NEVER be one of my boxes in WalMart!<br/>
<br/>
Let me know when you come to town. There are great little places for<br/>
lunch smack dab in the middle of the Cabinet!<br/>
