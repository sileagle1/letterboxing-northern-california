Mine is - I'm perfectly satisfied with the way things are now. Keep in mind <br/>
that I receive list messages by email, so I don't have to visit two <br/>
separate boards like some of you do just to read everything.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I'm just a fan of conflict. :-)<br/>

Ahhh....  But you'll end up getting double the e-mail if people start <br/>
posting identical posts to both boards to cover all the bases.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I can't think of one, single reason to continue on with this <br/>
overlapping territory of the two talk lists, so their territories <br/>
need to be changed so they don't overlap.  It *needs* to get done.  <br/>
I'm just trying to figure out the least painful way of doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Any vote for keeping things as is I'll consider to mean "I don't care <br/>
what happens".  Which is an understandable choice--some people <br/>
probably don't care which solution is implemented, just so long as <br/>
SOMETHING is done.  Both proposed solutions are better than what's in <br/>
place now!  =)<br/>
