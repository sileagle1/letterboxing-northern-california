Did  someone mention a gathering for LbNCA soon? I haven't poured <br/>
through the  past posts, but I did see a reference to the fact that <br/>
Golden Gate Park is  NOT under the jurisdiction of the National Park <br/>
Service -- it's an SF  managed park, and open to boxes. If the <br/>
gathering isn't during 7/20 - 7/30  (NY trip), count me in.<br/>

Welcome back to the planet! A day late, we fear. We had a nice showing for  a <br/>
meet-n-greet in S.F. yesterday for Bandaid and her hubby and daughter from <br/>
CT.  No 'boxing, just exchanging and LOTS of personal travelers.<br/>
<br/>
We're discussing a Gathering in August but no date or firm location yet.  <br/>
Want to make it a cool as possible so no farther east than Oakland. Talking  <br/>
about regional parks-maybe Hayward. Any suggestions? <br/>
