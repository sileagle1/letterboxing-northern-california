How wonderful to hear from you. The circus has grown so large that it<br>
travels in smaller troupes and can be in three or four places at once.<br>

<br>
Look through the listing of acts and send me an idea of how many and<br>
what interests you and I'll put together a troupe to travel west.<br>
<br>
Do, please reply to the other e-mail address as I look at that one more<br>
often.<br>

Most prespicaciously yours,<br>

Hi it is mims again, so I only have firsthand knowldege of the flea<br>

stamps...so If people want to suggest some that sound good I will let<br>
the ringmaster know.<br>

I'd love to see any of these, but in particular perhaps Elephant, <br>
Amazing Fish Girl, Tattooed Lady, Dancing Dog, Steam Calliope Wagon, <br>
Madame Natascha, Tiger, and Magical Liberty Horse.  Any that can come to <br>

Thanks so much for suggesting it!<br>
