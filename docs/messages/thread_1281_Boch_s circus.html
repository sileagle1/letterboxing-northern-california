How wonderful to hear from you. The circus has grown so large that it<br/>
travels in smaller troupes and can be in three or four places at once.<br/>
May I suggest that you check out the Schedule and Roster on<br/>
Atlasquest.com.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=9629<br/>
<br/>
Look through the listing of acts and send me an idea of how many and<br/>
what interests you and I'll put together a troupe to travel west.<br/>
<br/>
Do, please reply to the other e-mail address as I look at that one more<br/>
often.<br/>

Most prespicaciously yours,<br/>
