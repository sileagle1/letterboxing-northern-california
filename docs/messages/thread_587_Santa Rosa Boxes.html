Hello!<br/>
 I will be going to Santa Rosa on Friday, from the Eureka area, and <br/>
I am so excited to get some letterboxes out of my area. I was hoping <br/>
to get some info on the letterboxes in that area. Any must see <br/>
boxes? I am also really curious about PlanetWalk. It says it was <br/>
placed in 1969, is that true? Is there a story?<br/>
 Since I won't have all day to letterbox, should I go to Sugarloaf <br/>
Ridge State Park, or just stick to ones in town? Any insight I could <br/>
get would be awesome!<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I suppose we could make up a story, because the real one certainly<br/>
isn't very interesting.  =)  On LbNA, if you don't include the date a<br/>
box was planted, it defaults to Dec 31, 1969.  That's the earliest<br/>
date the timestamp field it uses can support.<br/>
<br/>
There are no boxes on LbNA that were planted before 1998 or so.  And<br/>
the VAST majority weren't planted until the last few years.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

Hmmmm, depends on what you are up for.  If you want lots of boxes <br/>
and are up for a hike then PlanetWalk, Sideways, Abamit and Wine <br/>
Country are the ticket...plus if you have time you could go to Glen <br/>
Ellen acrsos the valley maybe ten minutes and get the boxes <br/>
there...at lease 5 drivebys and two others requiring short hikes.  <br/>
Prepare for a hot day if so (sunhat, sunblock, lots of water and <br/>
good shoes.)  <br/>
<br/>
if not the Santa Rosa boxes are slim... I retired Round the Squares, <br/>
too much vandalism and you have to watch the movie Shadow of Doubt <br/>
to do that box.  PAradise Ridege Oaks in nice one in the hills of <br/>
Santa Rosa (aka Fountaingrove).  And Ma-ki-la is essentially a drive <br/>
by while going from Santa ROsa to GLen Ellen.  IF you just did the <br/>
Santa Rosa boxes you would have time to go to Petaluma and do <br/>
American Graffiti, homer and Schollenberger park.....or stop in <br/>
Healdsburg n your way donw and do the Healdsburg Quartet.  I would <br/>
read all the various clues and see what appeals to you.  <br/>

<br/>
Just putting in my two cents about the Santa Rosa<br/>
boxes. To do all the Sugar Loaf Ridge boxes requires<br/>
MAJOR hiking (is it hot now? erk...), which is great<br/>
if you are prepared for it, and don't plan to go<br/>
anywhere else that day (start early). But you can<br/>
limit your hike and get quite a few great boxes:<br/>
Planet Walk through Saturn (I think), Abamit and her<br/>
Shadow, and the first of the Sideways to Gray Pine<br/>
series. I haven't made it to Pomo Hummingbird yet, but<br/>
that is there as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you limit SLRSP in this way, it is entirely<br/>
conceivable that you could then also do Santa Rosa's<br/>
Four Seasons (very nice stamps and walk), and some<br/>
stuff in Glen Ellen or Petaluma. And/or a stop-off in<br/>
Healdsburg. By the way, I have word that Healdsburg<br/>
Quartet #3 has gone missing. I'm trying to confirm<br/>
that, but my mom has been busy and hasn't gone to<br/>
check for me yet. <br/>
<br/>
I will mail more suggestions to you off-list.<br/>
