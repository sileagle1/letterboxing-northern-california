                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is Princess Lea reporting from the road from Quechee VT.  I have<br>
been here for about 10 days so if you have written to me directly and I<br>
have not responded - that's why!  Internet access has been limited at<br>
best.  I was here for my birthday and, naturally, when letterboxing! <br>
Unfortunately it has been raining EVERY DAY so there have been many<br>
frustrating days when I should have been out on the trails.  I spent<br>
some time in Tolland County CT where there are so many boxes you<br>
practically trip over them - definitely the center of the LB universe.<br>
<br>
Welcome to the list to all the new folks - sounds like Grinch & Grumpy<br>
are off to a running start!  The San Jose Egypt Game boxes have not<br>
been replanted yet.  Last time I checked there were 2 large bulldozers<br>
on the site, so renovations are still continuing.  I'll let you know on<br>
the clues page when they are ready.<br>

We'll be in Quechee, VT ourselves next month. We'll need to pick your brain <br>
about which boxes to go for. Sorry it's been raining so much.<br>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br>
but good impressions. Sir B<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Princess Lea.  We'll be patient and skip the Egypt Game until <br>
you replace the boxes there.  I can't believe we lived 11 years in <br>
New Hampshire and never knew about letterboxing!  So many boxes and <br>
so much time wasted...  Enjoy Vermont.<br>
