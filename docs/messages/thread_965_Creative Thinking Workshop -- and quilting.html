That's an interesting quilt design, and subscribes to my style of part <br/>
structured, part free form. Jusat spotted another relationship: that <br/>
web pages mentions 'ocean optics'... I worked on a quilt design (now <br/>
abandoned) that took it's inspiration from Lindos, nepenthe, and the <br/>
light playing on and through the surface of the ocean. It also had <br/>
lots of tiny squares and triangles. Somehow some of that inspiration <br/>
returned and became... the Nepenthe letterbox!<br/>

[lisa - Maybe I'll do a box called, 'The Great Alarm Clock Thief <br/>
Hoax'.]<br/>
<br/>
Did someone say 'too many projects'?... Ha ha ha ...!<br/>
