letterboxers might be able to help out, by looking for oiled wildlife.<br>
<br>
***********************************************************<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd like to issue a special plea for birders please to<br>
try and get to "places less traveled" where you know there to be<br>
birds. We got over 40 calls yesterday reporting one oiled surf scoter<br>
at Crissy Fields; one call reporting 40 oiled clapper rails in<br>
Anderson Marsh would really help sort out rescue triage.<br>
<br>
The sooner, the better. The faster we can get these birds stabilized<br>
and washed, the higher their chances of recovery and survival.<br>
<br>
Calls from the general public wanting to volunteer outnumbered bird<br>
reports yesterday by about 5-1. Volunteer opportunities for untrained<br>
members of the public are going to be very limited over the next few<br>
days but here's a critical one: please make a special effort to look<br>
for oiled birds in places where the general public doesn't go. Don't<br>
approach or touch the birds but call 877-823-6926 and provide the<br>
location (be very specific, GPS coordinates are great), the species,<br>
number of birds seen, whether dead or alive, and percentage of oiling.<br>
Please leave your name and a contact phone number. We are inundated<br>
and most of my veterinary and administrative coworkers have left<br>
Davis; of the ones of us still here who are answering this number, I'm<br>
the only one who's likely to know what a clapper rail is, so please be<br>
patient if you get through to a live person.<br>
<br>
Under no circumstances should people touch or approach an oiled animal<br>
unless they have HAZWOPER training and are properly equipped. If you<br>
see someone doing this, please remind them that this is toxic material.<br>
<br>
Many thanks.<br>
