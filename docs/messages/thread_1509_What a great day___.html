                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks from Anna and the kid(s) for such a great time at the event <br/>
yesterday--<br/>
<br/>
To Renee and 3Catfam for hosting a Martha Stewart level event(did <br/>
you see those table runners???)-- every detail was perfect-- so much <br/>
to do and see for all of us at every level of skill and mobility-- <br/>
Your hospitality was limitless--<br/>
<br/>
To those tricksters and humorists of the scatological persuasion-- I <br/>
applaud the authenticity of your endeavors in both sight and sound <br/>
(thank goodness no smell!!!).  The self-filling whoopee cushion <br/>
cootie was an amazing thing--I really should have noticed those <br/>
giggling children around me and the sudden quiet as I plopped myself <br/>
down on that well cushioned bench-- especially the SECOND TIME!!!!<br/>
<br/>
For the attendees who carved and planted beautiful boxes for us all <br/>
to share-- <br/>
<br/>
And for the wonderful new friends made from near and far-- <br/>
<br/>
Many, many thanks from Anna and the kids<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
