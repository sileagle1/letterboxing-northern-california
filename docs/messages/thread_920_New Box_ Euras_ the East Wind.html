                    <div class="plaintext-content">To mark the very last day of my 6 week sabbatical, I planted Euras, <br/>
the East Wind, which is my 30th planted box. Clues are at:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=9972<br/>
<br/>
It's yet another large stamp with carved drapery folds and feathered <br/>
wings...  and it's fairly close to 3 other boxes, 2 of mine and 1 of <br/>
RedSF's. It's in an odd, but interesting spot that few people know <br/>
about (except RedSF knows it).<br/>
<br/>
Later this week, I'll post clues for a box that has my Most <br/>
Fabulously Eyepopping Carved Stamp to date: The Day of the Dead! <br/>
It's very big, and very ornately detailed. I won't risk having it <br/>
vanish, so it will be hosted at a wonderful little folk art shop. <br/>
Details to follow.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, that minotaur is still grunting and snorting in the <br/>
background! <br/>
<br/>
Awww... back to work tomorrow!<br/>
