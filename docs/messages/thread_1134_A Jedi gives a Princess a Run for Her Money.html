I'll just use the excuse that I was 2,000 miles away at the time, <br>
planting boxes in the practically letterbox-free area of St. Louis MO.  <br>
But I've got my eye on that OBJuan...  And just so you know, Leia does <br>
become a Jedi Knight herself in the books that fill in the details <br>
about what happens after the movies.<br>
<br>
And it's back to the Wave Organ for us all!  You do know that there was <br>
an early Paul in SF box out there that got geotrashed a couple of <br>
times?  I'm going to try and buzz out there this week and grab the <br>
image just in case...<br>

I found that box last August or so, and had never been out there, but it's<br>
a great spot and Paul's stamp was (as always) spectacular.  I'm hoping to<br>
find Lisa's new one this weekend and take a friend out there for the first<br>
time for some great photo ops.  Looks like Lea might beat me to FTF<br>
though! :)<br>

The force is strong in this Lisascenic. She was correct in her <br>
assessment that my intention was to obtain this box before Princess <br>
Lea. With her in St. Louis, it was easy to outfox the Fox. Now I'm <br>
off to 1932 to visit my friend Sam Spade. . .<br>

It is a serious error in judgement of character to suppose a Jedi is a <br>
Sith. The difference is indescribable.<br>

><br>
I recently returneed from a month-long to Sam Spade in 1932. I <br>
watched as he finished the filming of the movie "Up the River". He <br>
really loves Hollywood and says, "this is what dreams are made of". <br>
<br>
I initially returned today but realized that Princess Lea had posted <br>
her new Huckelberry Finn box so I went back 3 days to be sure I was <br>
the first finder. I consider her one of the Gems of the Universe.<br>
