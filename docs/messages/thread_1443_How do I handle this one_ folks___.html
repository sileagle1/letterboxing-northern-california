<br/>
Hi Lisascenic,<br/>
I'm brand new to Letterboxing... today was the first day I tried it.<br/>
<br/>
It's a bit of a long story (I hope you read it all!) but... my Mom<br/>
does it with my nieces and nephew on the East Coast and loves it. She<br/>
was trying to enter a "found" one online and had trouble so she went<br/>
surfing for the ones on the West Coast and found the one at<br/>
Scharrfenberger - where I've taken her &amp; my Dad when they came to<br/>
visit us.<br/>
<br/>
My father-in-law had a stroke in December and my husband and<br/>
mother-in-law have been in a serious funk since then (and spending<br/>
most free time at the nursing home). My mother encouraged us to go to<br/>
Scharffen Berger to do something fun, take the tour, have lunch - and<br/>
find the letterbox stamp to send to my nephew next month for his birthday.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line to this whole story is that we couldn't find it<br/>
anywhere. Not having done this before I don't know how hard it<br/>
normally is, but we searched for quite a while (and got some staff &amp;<br/>
other visitors to Scharffen Berger involved too!) and had no luck. The<br/>
staff at SB have told us that other people have asked them for help<br/>
(the most recent last week), but no one has come back to tell them<br/>
where it is.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I'm writing for more help... can you either give me more<br/>
clues so I can go back soon to see if it's still there or even tell me<br/>
where it is (I don't know if that's "cheating" or defeats the point of<br/>
letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
I do live near Ardenwood Farm, so one day soon I'll head out there<br/>
too, to see if the one you placed there is easier to find or not.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for this long message. As an aside, my husband, mother-in-law<br/>
and I had a wonderful day at Scharffen Berger, so even if we never end<br/>
up finding the stamp, while my nephew will be bummed, we appreciate<br/>
your work! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Loretta<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">She sounds like a really sweet person whose enthusiasm might jeopardize your<br/>
box - I can totally understand you being miffed.  It also sounds like she's<br/>
not the only one to have asked for help!  I suggest you write a raging email<br/>
to let her have it!... then delete it and send one of your well written,<br/>
kind, and informative notes that will help her better understand this sport!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting everyone know about this - I think we make assumptions<br/>
that the person reading our clues will have some experience and with<br/>
understand what "stealth" means.  In the clue for my Junkyard Dog box I<br/>
mentioned that the box was planted without permission and to be stealthy,<br/>
but I think I'll ammend the clue to specify that no one should ask the staff<br/>
for help!<br/>
<br/>
I still haven't found the Scharffenberger box and I hope it's still there<br/>
when I get back over there to take a look.<br/>

Hi Loretta,<br/>
<br/>
It's always great to hear letterboxing stories.<br/>
The Scharffen Berger box has been pulled for the time being.  Thanks for<br/>
letting me know that the staff were aware of the box!  That could really<br/>
have compromised it's safety.  I'm glad I got to it before it<br/>
"disappeared". Whew!<br/>
Before you go out to find other stamp impressions for your nephew's<br/>
birthday, you may want to learn some more about it.  Check out<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/GettingStarted/<br/>
I know there's a lot of information there so I've included some of it<br/>
here:<br/>
<br/>
    * The most important things to remember when letterboxing are respect<br/>
and safety. Respect for the environment and for the letterbox that<br/>
someone has created and your personal safety.<br/>
    * Letterboxes should always be hidden in publicly-accessible areas,<br/>
yet out of sight of casual visitors.<br/>
    * Leave the location better than you find it; you are encouraged<br/>
toremove any litter left behind by people who care less for the land<br/>
thanyou.<br/>
    * When you arrive at the location of the letterbox by following the<br/>
clues, make sure that there aren't others around when you go to<br/>
retrieve it to prevent it's location from being discovered by others<br/>
who might not respect the letterbox.<br/>
    * There are hazards of letterboxing, such as poison ivy and<br/>
creatureslike snakes or spiders who tend to like the same crevices and<br/>
cavities where letterboxes are often hidden.<br/>
    * Letterbox with a partner or let others know where you are going. <br/>
Use common sense to letterbox safely.<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing!  It's a really great hobby &amp; creative outlet. <br/>
I'm glad you had a lovely day out, even without finding the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails<br/>
<br/>
            And then I turn the whole thing over to Dorks Anonymous to<br/>
"nice" it up.  He's a natural                 copy-editor and I just<br/>
cannot tell whether I'm funny or mean in print.<br/>

I agree that it is probably a good time to "find" your own box and <br/>
take it home for a short while - just long enough for the employees to <br/>
search and lose their curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
You certainly should remind the newcomer of the need for discretion <br/>
and point her to the newcomers FAQ!  Then vent if you will - or <br/>
compliment her enthusiasm and offer to teach her to knit instead of <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>

such a note. I don't even think it needed "nicing up", but<br/>
DA does have a nice touch. Lisa, you could tell her you've<br/>
pulled the box (even post it that way) until you get a chance<br/>
to actually do so. Doublesaj used the words "don't ask, don't tell"<br/>
for a box she had clandestinely planted in a bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
My letterboxing age is only two and a half, so my experience is<br/>
limited, but it does seem that there has been a surge of new boxers<br/>
and even new boxes of late. We really need to do all we can (nicely!)<br/>
to encourage all to participate consciously. Personally, I don't<br/>
want *everyone* to know what this is, but I don't want to have an<br/>
"I've got mine now you go away" attitude, either. It does make a<br/>
case for listing boxes as for premium members only, though, or some<br/>
other way that takes as much work to get ahold of the clues as it<br/>
does to figure them out.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I hit the road, so I may be out of touch for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
aT, hoping you are all staying warm and healthy<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This sounds like the recurring nightmare I have about my boxes - that some guileless <br/>
person out there will inadvertantly contribute to their demise.  I like the addendum about <br/>
the secrecy of letterboxing - it may or may not help.  Luckily the Scharffenberger box is so <br/>
well hidden that even veterans (ahem, like myself) have difficulty finding it, so I think it is <br/>
unlikely that the staff will stumble upon it.  I am a little horrified that she is not the first <br/>
person to ask the staff!  Wonder how many people out there have asked rangers for <br/>
assistance....<br/>
<br/>
I've always wondered if some kind of rating system to indicate that a box is a good one for <br/>
"beginners" would be helpful.  Certain boxes of mine are quite straightforward and are <br/>
perfect for first time finders.  I like having them around so that some of my more difficult <br/>
boxes are protected from enthusiastic but "unseasoned" boxers who just need a little time <br/>
to see how to play this game.<br/>
<br/>
On a totally different note, I am hoping that our artists in residence, Lisa and Kel (aT) are <br/>
thinking about designs for the patch - I'd really like to see what you ladies come up with!  <br/>
We had previously discussed a Northern California logo (redwoods? gold? grizzlies?), and <br/>
the new proposal on the table is a patch for all of California - do we have a preference?<br/>

&gt; Hi Lisascenic,<br/>
&gt; I'm brand new to Letterboxing... today was the first day I tried it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's a bit of a long story (I hope you read it all!) but... my Mom<br/>
&gt; does it with my nieces and nephew on the East Coast and loves it. She<br/>
&gt; was trying to enter a "found" one online and had trouble so she went<br/>
&gt; surfing for the ones on the West Coast and found the one at<br/>
&gt; Scharrfenberger - where I've taken her &amp; my Dad when they came to<br/>
&gt; visit us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My father-in-law had a stroke in December and my husband and<br/>
&gt; mother-in-law have been in a serious funk since then (and spending<br/>
&gt; most free time at the nursing home). My mother encouraged us to go to<br/>
&gt; Scharffen Berger to do something fun, take the tour, have lunch - and<br/>
&gt; find the letterbox stamp to send to my nephew next month for his birthday.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The bottom line to this whole story is that we couldn't find it<br/>
&gt; anywhere. Not having done this before I don't know how hard it<br/>
&gt; normally is, but we searched for quite a while (and got some staff &amp;<br/>
&gt; other visitors to Scharffen Berger involved too!) and had no luck. The<br/>
&gt; staff at SB have told us that other people have asked them for help<br/>
&gt; (the most recent last week), but no one has come back to tell them<br/>
&gt; where it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I guess I'm writing for more help... can you either give me more<br/>
&gt; clues so I can go back soon to see if it's still there or even tell me<br/>
&gt; where it is (I don't know if that's "cheating" or defeats the point of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do live near Ardenwood Farm, so one day soon I'll head out there<br/>
&gt; too, to see if the one you placed there is easier to find or not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for this long message. As an aside, my husband, mother-in-law<br/>
&gt; and I had a wonderful day at Scharffen Berger, so even if we never end<br/>
&gt; up finding the stamp, while my nephew will be bummed, we appreciate<br/>
&gt; your work! Thanks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; Loretta<br/>

(ahem, like myself) have difficulty finding it...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the inadvertent pep talk!  <br/>
I was in the area last week and thought I would make an attempt. But<br/>
after a cursory look, I realized there was no way I was going to be<br/>
nonchalant with that much metal on and around the outside of that<br/>
building, so I bailed until I could go when they were closed. I<br/>
figured I was just being the lazy noob. <br/>
Glad to hear disgression was the better part of valor.<br/>

&gt; This sounds like the recurring nightmare I have about my boxes -<br/>
that some guileless <br/>
&gt; person out there will inadvertantly contribute to their demise.  I<br/>
like the addendum about <br/>
&gt; the secrecy of letterboxing - it may or may not help.  Luckily the<br/>
Scharffenberger box is so <br/>
&gt; well hidden that even veterans (ahem, like myself) have difficulty<br/>
finding it, so I think it is <br/>
&gt; unlikely that the staff will stumble upon it.  I am a little<br/>
horrified that she is not the first <br/>
&gt; person to ask the staff!  Wonder how many people out there have<br/>
asked rangers for <br/>
&gt; assistance....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've always wondered if some kind of rating system to indicate that<br/>
a box is a good one for <br/>
&gt; "beginners" would be helpful.  Certain boxes of mine are quite<br/>
straightforward and are <br/>
&gt; perfect for first time finders.  I like having them around so that<br/>
some of my more difficult <br/>
&gt; boxes are protected from enthusiastic but "unseasoned" boxers who<br/>
just need a little time <br/>
&gt; to see how to play this game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a totally different note, I am hoping that our artists in<br/>
residence, Lisa and Kel (aT) are <br/>
&gt; thinking about designs for the patch - I'd really like to see what<br/>
you ladies come up with!  <br/>
&gt; We had previously discussed a Northern California logo (redwoods?<br/>
gold? grizzlies?), and <br/>
&gt; the new proposal on the table is a patch for all of California - do<br/>
we have a preference?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey folks -- I'm wondering how you would reply to the following<br/>
letter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've already written to this person to give them a few hints....so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel like I've done my part.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; However, I'm horrified and appalled that they got the staff involved<br/>
&gt; &gt; in this hunt. My clues says:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "You're going to Scharffen Berger.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Outside.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Magnetic.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For the love of God, please use stealth! "<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've added this note to the end of my (formerly) short and elegant<br/>
clues.:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Letterboxing is a secretive past time. Please, please, please, please<br/>
&gt; &gt; do NOT ask passers-by to help you find this letterbox. Don't ask the<br/>
&gt; &gt; staff to help you look... If everyone knows that the letterbox is<br/>
&gt; &gt; there, it ruins the secret for everyone."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Am I being overly sensitive, or am I within my rights to be a bit<br/>
&gt; &gt; annoyed with this seeker?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've got to write them back, but I need to simmer down a bit. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; suspect I'll write something about how in letterboxing -- as in life<br/>
&gt; &gt; -- you don't always find what you're seeking, but that the journey is<br/>
&gt; &gt; often more important than the destination.<br/>
