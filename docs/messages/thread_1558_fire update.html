  We're praying for you....  think positive..... <br/>
<br/>
  One word of experience from the So. Cal fires... clean out your freezer and refridge if you haven't already and if you have a chance. With the power being out, the rotting food with ruin them if the power is out for very long.  When I volunteered at the So. Cal fires, people either had one of two problems. The ruined freezer and refridge was the #1 problem of those with houses left.   So we KNOW you place will survive.. so I hope you can save your freezer and refridge will too<br/>

  Love ya<br/>
