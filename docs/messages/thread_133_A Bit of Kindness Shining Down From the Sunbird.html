                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, the Sunbird flew down from its perch for a quick visit today. <br/>
He came to admonish me for being so cruel, making the font size for <br/>
the clues too small and purposely hard to read. Mr. Sunbird said it <br/>
was bad enough that I make everyone suffer reading that wacky font. <br/>
He suspects I've written ranson notes in one of my prior lives. <br/>
(Well, I did just watch Dirty Harry...)<br/>
<br/>
Then Mr. Sunbird flew off in a flurry of feathers, back to his <br/>
hiding perch, high above SF... and almost not fast enough. My two <br/>
cats, Reno and Vegas, woke from their naps and saw a rare <br/>
opportunity to validate themselves as hunters. (Sorry, furry <br/>
buddies).<br/>
<br/>
The guilt trip Sunbird left behind made a tiny ray of sunlight shine <br/>
in my heart, and so, my letterbox colleagues, I have increased the <br/>
font size for the clues (but not too much). Thank the Sunbird for <br/>
that -- I'm not usually that softhearted [tiny evil smirk and a bit <br/>
of a blush].<br/>
<br/>
So go birdwatching, but don't be birdbrains, OK?<br/>
