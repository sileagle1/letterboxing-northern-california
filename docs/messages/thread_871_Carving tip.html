                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe some of you have already heard of this, but I learned a carving <br/>
tip from one of the LbNY members while I was in NY this summer. Was it <br/>
you, Lisascenic?<br/>
<br/>
You get some additional refinement of detail by wrapping your carving <br/>
material around a curved object. I used a big can of cocoa, for <br/>
example, and taped the pink stuff down to the can. It seems that this <br/>
opens up the pores of the material, and in its slightly stretched <br/>
form, you get better detail. I see it, but to me, it's subtle.<br/>
<br/>
If you've found both Notus and Zephyrus wind gods, look at the stamped <br/>
impressions in your book closely. Notus was done in the standard <br/>
manner, and Zephyrus was taped to the can.<br/>
<br/>
I bet that if I were more fastidious, and used an Exacto knife for <br/>
fine details, this tip would help a lot. <br/>
<br/>
Well, folks, as of today, my sabbatical begins -- a six week paid <br/>
break from work. We get them once every 5 years, and this is my 10th <br/>
year of working for Charles Schwab. That means more time for <br/>
letterboxing, of course!<br/>

I wish I could get the hang of an X-acto knife. I'm just amazed at<br/>
what some people can do with them. I think I might be too impatient. I<br/>
never really got the shading down either. Argh!<br/>

Congrats! =) So what do you plan to do for six weeks? Surely more than<br/>
just letterbox!? Perhaps letterboxing in foreign countries or riding<br/>
your bike cross country? (Do you have a bike?)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We get them once every 5 years, and this is my 10th <br/>
&gt; year of working for Charles Schwab.<br/>
<br/>
You work for Charles Schwab? Hmm.... That surprises me. =) They seem<br/>
too 'stuck up' for your bubbling personality. Wouldn't have taken you<br/>
as a corporate guy! More like the essentric artist. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

PS. Princess Lea--if you master the art of shading, teach me some day!<br/>
Or just let me watch a master in action for a few minutes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Pshaw Paul, I can't imagine being put in the same category of the<br/>
amazing Ms. ArtTrekker.  Her work blows me away!  In addition to her<br/>
sensitive (and so restrained) use of line, I just adore her<br/>
compositions.  I'm still at the will-it-fit-in-the-box phase of<br/>
composing my images.  Hopefully, I'll grow past that.  I think her<br/>
stamps On the Gold Trail may be one of my favorite relief prints of<br/>
all time.  It makes me think of Japanese woodblock prints, with their<br/>
incredible compositions, and implied narratives.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is...even though this is sort of a holy grail of stamp<br/>
carving, I never really think about fine detail.  I like large areas<br/>
of tone.  I have a set of micro carvers that I never use, mostly<br/>
because they are the "u" shaped blade, and lately I prefer the "v"<br/>
blade or the very shallow curved flattish linoleum cutter.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not one of those carve-on-the-trail artists.  I tend to chew on an<br/>
idea for an image for a while, and then crank out a stamp quite<br/>
quickly.  I also have a weird attitude about my stamps; I just assume<br/>
that they're going out into the world, never to be seen again, so I<br/>
just don't fret over them so much.  I think about my own work that way<br/>
(I'm a theatrical scenic artist -- I run the paint shop for Berkeley<br/>
Repertory Theatre and also for Glimmerglass Opera).  We put a lot of<br/>
love and care into our work, but for the most part, when the show is<br/>
over, the scenery is going into the dumpster.  I HATE this<br/>
ecologically, but I sort of love this in a sick way, otherwise.  It<br/>
keeps me from fretting about making an acknowledged masterpiece every<br/>
workday (THE STRESSSSSSSSSS!), because I know that my scenery will<br/>
have a very short lifespan.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best advice I would give to anyone wanting to expand their<br/>
 carving vocabulary is to look at relief prints, and figure out why a<br/>
particular image "grabs" you.  Like any other technique, relief<br/>
printing has technical parameters, and you generally have to embrace<br/>
those.  Sure, some fine artists make linoleum or pear wood or carved<br/>
cardboard do things that you wouldn't think possible, but I have to<br/>
say, I just love the look of a "typical" linoleum or woodblock print.<br/>
 Kaethe Kollwitz is my hero, for a lot of reasons.  Look her up!  I've<br/>
also been thinking about Hiroshige, lately.  Not that it shows in my<br/>
silly lil stamps.  But it is nice to consider the pantheon of relief<br/>
printing from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
blablabla...sorry....  I didn't know I had so much to say on this<br/>

<br/>
I have a variety of creative pursuits to overwhelm me, many neglected. <br/>
I'm also a landscape painter in pastels and watercolors, and I want to <br/>
do some painting. Two weeks in Manhattan, staying with a friend, with <br/>
lots of museum time, punctuated with some letterboxing, and an <br/>
exchange with Miss Moon.<br/>
<br/>
You must have missed the posts where I announced that I now own the <br/>
ultimate letterboxing vehicle: 150cc scooter. Although I can't go on <br/>
freeways (my max speed is 55mph), I can maneuver into parking spots <br/>
the size of tiny bit of curb. I fill my gas tank for $3.<br/>

<br/>
Schwab is a corporation that embraces diversity in both backgrounds <br/>
and in styles. I have a unique position working as a multimedia <br/>
designer and producer for training, mostly for management programs. I <br/>
have both left and sides of the brain in action at work. You're right, <br/>
I'm not 'corporate', but creativity combined with practical business <br/>
application is highly sought after in successful organizations.<br/>
<br/>
On my list of future 'To Do' letterboxes is one about money, how we <br/>
use it, translate it, make it, spend it and lose it.<br/>
<br/>
But now my work brain is turned off for 6 weeks, and I'm focusing on <br/>
finishing my "Minotaur's Maze" now.<br/>
