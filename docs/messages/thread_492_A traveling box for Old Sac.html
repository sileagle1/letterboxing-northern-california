This is just a heads up, that hopefully will spark some more <br>
creative ideas out there.  Since it may not be possible for me to <br>
scout Old Sac in advance for a good hiding place(although I would <br>
love another excuse to go find Lemony Snicket), I have decided to <br>
make my stamp a traveling one.  <br>
<br>
The working Title is "Armed Robbery" and it involves a <br>
stagecoach.....Stay tuned for clues to be posted within the next <br>
month which will involve watching a classic western and sending me <br>
the answers to trivia questions which will grant you access to a <br>
locked box.  OF course I will entertain answers the event day as <br>
well, but you will need to see teh movie beforehand.<br>
<br>
In a sad note I have decided to retire ROund the Squares...I was <br>
trying to find better locations for boxes 1 and 4 (which have been <br>
missing for months now) yesterday, and discovered box 2 is now <br>
missing.  It appears these urban boxes had too much traffic to <br>
really keep them safe so I am pulling them.  <br>
<br>
Look for  another downtown Santa Rosa box appearing soon.....<br>

Sierra Sally, Buzzard, Gwen & I have an Outlaw series and it would be neat if you could join us. Buzzard has his Vasquez series, Sally has Sontag & Evans, Murietta, and we have a Vasquez series and a Black Bart. There is still alot of bad guys to use.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have several letterboxes based on California Outlaws.  The first was placed by Paperdance(no longer letterboxing?) at Vasquez Rocks in LA Co., and it is called Robbers Roost, and is about Tiburcio Vasquez. We placed the Coyote Hole Stage Robbery series in Kern Co. , and it too is about Vasquez(he was a real rogue). We have a semi mystery box in the general vicinity of Visalia called PO 8, and it is about Black Bart. Buzzard has a 6 box series in the Pasadena area that continues Vasquez's escapades after the two previously listed. Sierra Sally has a Murietta box and a Sontag and Evans letterbox. Each letterbox is based on real people and real events. Check out California history, particularly around the gold rush era, and you will have a wealth of ideas for letterboxes. If you check out the various clue sheets on these then you will get more of an idea. We welcome more outlaws!<br>
