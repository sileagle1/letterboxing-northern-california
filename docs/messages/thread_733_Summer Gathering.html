good for us. Just LOVE 'boxing with all of you!!<br/>

Since I can't be committal about a date or venue at this time, I'll just let those who can be figure out the best set-up, then try to make it. If anyone IS coming to Tahoe at some point, he can let me know &amp; I'll try to be available. Maybe we can work something out for the fall up this way.<br/>

For anyone interested in attending a summer "gabber-ing" please click <br/>
on the polls link in the left hand column.  There you will find a poll <br/>
that Princess Lea graciously set up to help pick a good date.  I would <br/>
like to finsalize a date soon...in the next week so I can put it on my <br/>
