But, I recently was hit with a huge wave of homesickness for a real 24 <br/>
hour diner.  I'm not talking Denny's or Lyon's, or Mel's.  I want a <br/>
good old chrome-adorned 24-hour diner.  The kind of place with a lunch <br/>
counter, that serves eggs at 4am, and where the waitresses call <br/>
you "Hon."  I want a place that's older than me, and not part of a <br/>
nifty-fifties chain.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of such a place, in the East Bay?<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, this really is a letterboxing question!<br/>

tradition with fantastic breakfasts.  People line up down the street <br/>
waiting to get in on the weekend mornings.  It's small and narrow <br/>
and *almost* feels like one of those great eastern diners.<br/>

- Tillie's in Alameda on Webster St. if definitely a throw back - the waitresses have <br/>
beehives and smoker's voice and call everyone hon.  Sounds like a winner!<br/>
