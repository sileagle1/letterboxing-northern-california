possible summer gatherings on LbNCA.  Silliyak and I would like to<br>
attend, and our schedule, except for June and one period in July, is<br>
pretty open.  I would opt for an August date, though there are times<br>
in July that would work also.  I'll keep watching and will join if I can.<br>
<br>
Silliyak and I have been experiencing a year of family deaths, and<br>
have just experienced yet another a couple of weeks ago.  So, while we<br>
haven't been as active lately, don't let that lull you into thinking<br>
that more boxes aren't being developed--thought admittedly they are in<br>
the conceptual stage.<br>
<br>
Here's hoping we will be emerging from all the trustee obligations<br>
soon and will have boxes to plant!!<br>
