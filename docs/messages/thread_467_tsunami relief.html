 <br>
I finally made my donation through AtlasQuest & Amazon (thanks, Ryan for providing the link), but in cruising the Holiday Inn website (confirming my reservation for Atlanta) I found that Intercontinental Hotels Group will match every donation to Unicef, dollar for dollar. Click the following link: http://www.unicefusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=9fLJJYOvHjE&b=279231<br>
and scroll down to donate now. This is a great way to make your donation go twice as far.<br>

Thanks for the link yourself!  =)  I'm all for doubling donations!<br>
<br>
I was going to replace the Amazon.com link on AQ with this new one,<br>
though I'm a bit concerned over the legalities of that.  From the<br>
looks of it, I think the link you provided is supposed to be for "IHG<br>
Priority Club Members" only--it's not meant to be opened for the<br>
general public.    So I'm going to go ahead and leave the Amazon.com<br>
one up on AQ for now--but I'd much prefer to see more bang for the<br>
buck provided at the link you suggested!  So, strange as it is, I<br>
won't put the link up on AQ, but I'm certainly happy to recommend it<br>
here!  =)<br>

<br>
Actually, it looks like the "special privilege number" is embedded as<br>
part of the link.  You mentioned discovering the link while confirming<br>
a reservation in Atlanta, so they probably started tracking you as<br>
soon as you logged in.  That's what the ?c=9fLJJYOvHjE&b=279231 part<br>
of the URL is.  You'll notice the link doesn't work without it and<br>
there's not really any reason to make it NOT work--unless the page is<br>
only supposed to be for members.<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>
