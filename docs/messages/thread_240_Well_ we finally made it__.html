<br/>
Clan Jiggs finally made it out here to the "wilds" of central <br/>
Ontario, and are now firmly entrenched back here in Canada. <br/>
<br/>
We just wanted to give everyone a big thank you for a wonderful year <br/>
of LBing on the "left coast" (we managed to hit all 4 LBNCA <br/>
gatherings!!), and hope that we can return the favour if you're ever <br/>
out our way.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to post a complete description of our travels on the main <br/>
site, as we pretty much hit all the main areas accross the country. <br/>
however, here's what we did out (t)here in the west....<br/>
<br/>
CA - stopped off at Sutter Buttes one last time (sniff) - this was <br/>
our first plant, almost exactly a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
NV - Unlock the Love - great stamp in beautiful downtown Lovelock! <br/>
Surprised to see so few visitors for this I80 driveby..but VERY <br/>
touched by the logbook sendoff from Don and Gwen (they somehow knew <br/>
we would be the next visitors and thoughtfully "reserved" the next <br/>
logbook page for us (properly filled now!)<br/>
<br/>
Freedom Fighters - Winnemucca - great, patriotic spot. Nice park and <br/>
picnic area, though box is outside of fence, with some suspicious <br/>
neighbour-types!!<br/>
<br/>
Carlin Canyon - Carlin - gorgeous spot, made even better by a <br/>
picture perfect day<br/>
Emigrant Trail - Carlin - it doesnt get more driveby than this!<br/>
White King - Elko WOW! The stuffed beast in the casino is HUGE!!<br/>
<br/>
We also drove through parts (some bigger than others) UT, CO, NM, <br/>
TX, OK, KS (saw Toto!!) MO, IL, IN, OH, PA and NY before crossing <br/>
into ON. Final tally was P2 F19 X3 HH2 met some brand-new LBers from <br/>
UT at the Buffalo Bill Cody box in CO - in all the time we 'boxed in <br/>
CA we NEVER met another LBer on the trail - bigger state, I guess!!) <br/>
We tried for a total of 25 boxes, with the majority of misses in KS, <br/>
MO and IN).<br/>
<br/>
We have managed to do some LBing here, but with only 30 or so boxes <br/>
in a province that stretches from the NY/VT border all the way to <br/>
MN, well  I think we'll be doing more plantin'!<br/>
<br/>
Take care all.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Glad you made it safely. Ontario is lucky to have some boxers that will <br/>
actually plant something! Why don't you set up a LBCanada yahoo group!<br/>
<br/>
Take care and keep us posted on your excursions.<br/>

but good impressions. Sir B<br/>
