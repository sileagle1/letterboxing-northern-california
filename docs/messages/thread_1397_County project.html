<br/>
Colusa County<br/>
Lake County<br/>
Sierra County<br/>
Yuba County (curiously, Yuba City which has 8 boxes is not in Yuba County)<br/>
<br/>
Also, Kings County has one box listed; it was by Tara, but clues are no longer available.  <br/>
Don't know the status of the actual box.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, the following counties have only 1 box, as far as I can tell:<br/>
<br/>
Amador County<br/>
Glenn County<br/>
Imperial County<br/>
Lassen County<br/>
<br/>
So I think the point of Spring Chick's exercise is to fill in all the counties.  You guys up for <br/>
it?<br/>

Thanks for doing the work to find Calif. counties lacking letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Coincidentally, I was speaking with a firend just today who suggested a place for a box in the Marysville area (Yuba County). We'll work on that one. Colusa county might be something we could do too.<br/>
<br/>
We'll keep you posted.<br/>
