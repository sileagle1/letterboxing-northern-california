                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to see that our first real heated exchange has died down now - it seems like every <br>
mailing list eventually has one of these skirmishes (you should see the fur fly over at the <br>
Nancy Drew group!)  Hope there are no hard feelings lingering out there.<br>
<br>
I am happy to report that I had a first over this past weekend - Amanda was in town and we <br>
were doing a Palo Alto/Peninsula loop and encountered the new folks Dem XX Men on the <br>
trail!  It's the first I have ever done an exchange on the fly like that.  We had been following <br>
them around all day (seeing their stamps in all the boxes we found at a certain unspeakable <br>
university) and had even found a hitchhiker they had left only hours before - we finally <br>
intersected paths at Baylands.  I am glad to have them in our midst - the stamp from the HH <br>
is quite imaginative and nicely carved.  I hope to get to the South Bay on Memorial Day <br>
weekend to get more of theirs and Aahz's too - my thoughts being that maybe there will be <br>
even more new boxes down there after "National Planting Day."  Plus I have a Girl Scout <br>
camping trip and weekend classes before then - give me strength!<br>
