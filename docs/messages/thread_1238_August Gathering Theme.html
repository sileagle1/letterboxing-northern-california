Bump City Boxing Celebration  - AKA BC2<br/>

One of Oakland's nicknames is Bump City.<br/>
This would allow for boxes on any Oakland theme.<br/>
<br/>
We don't have a serious opinion on the location since we aren't that <br/>
familiar with the parks in and around Oakland.  We'll leave that to <br/>
those of you who are in the know.<br/>

nickname and Wikipedia had it listed alont with Oak Town and The Town.<br/>
It didn't give the origin.  But if you look at a map of the east bay, <br/>
Oakland juts out, just like a bump along the shoreline.<br/>

Truly, we are not tied to any particular theme or gathering location.  <br/>
Just trying to spice up the discussion here.  Thinking outside the <br/>
box, and all that sort of thing.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
Oaksterdam relates only to a certain area of Oakland where there are several marijuana <br/>
clubs clustered - I think it is near Telegraph Ave.<br/>
<br/>
Back on the gathering topic, yes, there were a lot of boxes in Old Sac, but most of them <br/>
have since gone missing or were only "one day" stamps.  I would really like to see this <br/>
gathering go back to the woods.  I plan to hang out by the picnic area more than out on <br/>
the trails since I am local and can come back for the boxes another day, so I can keep <br/>
Robb company if you want to hit the trails Lisa.  Plus there are always people who prefer to <br/>
sit around and chat.<br/>
