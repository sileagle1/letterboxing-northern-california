I'm looking forward to seeing all of you on Sunday. I was just <br/>
wondering if anyone felt like carpooling? I'll be coming up from San <br/>
Jose, and I'd be happy to pick you up and drop you off on the way. <br/>
If you're interested, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Mim - I am bringing some homemade hummus and crackers for everyone. <br/>
I might even have a hitchhiker with me!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
