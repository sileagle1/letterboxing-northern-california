                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a WONDERFUL time visiting with the many Northern California <br>
Letterboxers at the Gold Rush Romp.  These are incredibly talented <br>
people w/their clever clues and AMAZING stamp carvings.  Also the <br>
cookies were a yummy, go directly to the hips, delight.  I haven't <br>
had homemade ice cream in years and now will have to do that <br>
regularly as summer fast approaches.  We had such a nice time seeing <br>
people and such avid boxers. I know this really took a lot of <br>
planning by Sally and the others so thank you for making us Southern <br>
California boxers so very welcomed.<br>
<br>
We also were able to find more stamps in the evening, and the <br>
following day we went to Rancho Cordova and found 9 more. So we <br>
really had a terrific 3-day total of finds. Pushing us over 250 and <br>
well on our way to 300. <br>
<br>
We enjoyed our after the event talk with Kel on various ideas of <br>
carvings, findings, etc. She is amazing talent of stamp carving. <br>
Never seen such beautiful artwork.  I'm now going to try my own <br>
personal stamp hopefully by the time of the next gathering in SoCal.<br>
<br>
Thanks Again to ALL who put this together, attended and helped.<br>
