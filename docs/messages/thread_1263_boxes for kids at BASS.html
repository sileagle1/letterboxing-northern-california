                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were thinking of doing some special boxes for kids that will be<br/>
attending the BASS.  Depending on resources/time/inspiration, each kid<br/>
could have his/her own (of course all kids would be welcome to stamp<br/>
in), or there might be a handful of general interest ones.  What I'm<br/>
wondering, is what are some interests of your younger boxers?  I know<br/>
we have some 'tweens, and some LITTLE ones--don't be afraid to go name<br/>
brand on me:  Bob the Builder, Bratz, Dora the Explorer, Pirates of<br/>
the Carribean (don't worry--there won't be any store-bought stamps ;)<br/>
), or more generic--horses, boats, airplanes, famous Rennaissance<br/>
artists, ancien Egypt, etc.  If I get some definite answers, this<br/>
could be cool.  <br/>
<br/>
SO--to recap--if you have a minor attending the event or possibly<br/>
attending the event, email me some ideas of what would make them sqeal<br/>
with delight for their own personalized letter box (no grownups allowed!).<br/>
<br/>
thanks--dorks anonymous<br/>
