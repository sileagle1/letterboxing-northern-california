Rattlesnake Dick Takes a Hostage<br/>
<br/>
Rattlesnake Dick reappeared for the first time in months on the quiet <br/>
waterfront of Old Sacramento yesterday. The despicable desperado <br/>
wasted no time in continuing his felonious ways. Witnesses say he <br/>
kidnapped our own Sister Rose as she walked her dog "Moses" down the <br/>
street. Witness Hezekiah Greenwood said, "That nasty old Dick first <br/>
stole her sassparilla and drank it down right in front of her. Then <br/>
he called her a sissy. And if that ain't bad enough, he kicked poor <br/>
old Moses." <br/>
<br/>
Mathilda McGillicutty standing outside her husband's store, said she <br/>
saw Rattlesnake Dick grab Sister Rose by the arm and flung her on to <br/>
the back of his horse. Dick then yelled, "Grab hold, Sister! We're <br/>
gonna ride!!" McGillicutty added, "I swear I heard the fine Sister <br/>
giggle as she wrapped her arms around him and they galloped away. <br/>
Course I'm sure she was just holding on for dear life."<br/>
<br/>
County Sheriff Coleman is forming a posse. He says he only wants <br/>
strong hikers willing to pack in enough water, sustenance and <br/>
sunscreen to last a 10-mile, 1,900 vertical foot hike. He suggests <br/>
the following volunteers: ArtTrekker, Tahoe Fiddler, Green Tortuga, <br/>
Amanda from Seattle, and any sorts who might be able to weather a <br/>
formidable trek. <br/>
