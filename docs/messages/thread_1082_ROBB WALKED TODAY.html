After his horrible spinal injury ten days ago, Robb took his first<br/>
steps during physical therapy.  If you could have seen the progress<br/>
that has occurred during the past week, you would be in awe of his spirit.<br/>

That's why I try to convince people to "leave some room for the <br/>
possibility of the impossible'. As humans, we have far more potential <br/>
than we're consciously aware of. <br/>
<br/>
Robb's positive thinking was most likely a major factor in keeping him <br/>
out of serious permanent damage as well as helping his fast recovery.<br/>
<br/>
Big cheers and a round of applause!<br/>
