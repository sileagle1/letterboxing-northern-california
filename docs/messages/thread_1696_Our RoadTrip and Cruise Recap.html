                    <div class="plaintext-content">After months of planning, we hit the road in our Prius on June 10th, <br/>
headed for New York to join the 1st Letterboxing Cruise to Bermuda.  <br/>
We returned home on July 11th, having driven 7,100 miles and sailed <br/>
1,900 miles.  We averaged 52 mpg, never ran out of gas nor had any <br/>
flat tires nor mechanical trouble as we traveled.<br/>
<br/>
We drove through California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, <br/>
Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, <br/>
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, <br/>
Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and California <br/>
again.  And, of course, we got to go to Bermuda with the letterboxing <br/>
cruise group. <br/>
<br/>
We found 11 hitchhikers, returned 14 to circulation, and launched one <br/>
new hitchhiker.  We found around 235 boxes and placed 20 of our own.  <br/>
<br/>
We went so many places we never would have seen if it weren't for <br/>
letterboxing.  We encountered mosquitoes, chiggers, deer flies and <br/>
ticks, but no poison ivy nor poison oak. <br/>
<br/>
We noticed more hand-carved stamps and fewer store-bought ones than <br/>
on previous road trips.  And the quality and intricacies of the <br/>
carvings seem to get better and better.  We didn't meet any other <br/>
boxers on the trails, nor did we set up mini meet and greets along <br/>
the way since our arrival schedule in each town was so <br/>
unpredictable.  We often found ourselves tarrying during the day and <br/>
getting in late in the evening.  But we did meet a number of amazing <br/>
letterboxers and fun folks on the cruise.  We look forward to seeing <br/>
many of them again in Oregon in September and/or in St. Louis next <br/>
July.<br/>
<br/>
On our journey we visited 4 generations of relatives in several <br/>
states, as well as numerous ancestors at a cemetery in upstate New <br/>
York.  We had a great time but are very, very happy to be home <br/>
again.  We are already busy planning several more trips in the <br/>
upcoming months.<br/>

Very Cute, artTrekker,<br/>
<br/>
We sure could use that DEET!  Actually, we just booked a week at a time <br/>
share near Stateline for next June.  We will just have to swat those <br/>
mosquitoes until then.<br/>
