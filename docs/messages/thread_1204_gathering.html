I saw the 10-box quilt series Choi just planted in Mass and am hoping <br/>
to be able to get it when we're back there in September. As for  quilt-<br/>
themed letterboxing gathering. . . I think there's too much dirt. I <br/>
have made a LbNA flag for our gathering though using quilt techniques. <br/>
Maybe I can hand out patterns for everyone to make one of their own!<br/>
<br/>
OK, so looks like we're talking August. We're available the 12th, 13th <br/>
and 19th.<br/>
