Hmm....  No, I guess I didn't know about that one.  Looks like it <br/>
only came into existance pretty recently.  Is it yours?  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I should change this one to focus on Northern California <br/>
letterboxing?  Although I'm not sure California really has enough <br/>
letterboxing activity to justify two separate talk lists.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.....<br/>
<br/>
Well, I tried to join, but am waiting for approval now.  It'll be <br/>
interesting to see what sort of chat is going on on that board and <br/>
why nobody ever told me about it!  (Certainly not because nobody <br/>
wants me there, right?  *innocent smile*)<br/>

I'd agree if there were more California letterboxes, but it is kind <br/>
of a hassle to go to several different talk lists if you're <br/>
interested in all California letterboxes (which I am).  If there ever <br/>
got to be over a thousand letterboxers active in California, I'd be <br/>
all over splitting them up.  As it is now....  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
When I first started letterboxing, there were probably on average ten <br/>
posts a day to the main talk list and I was happy to have all the <br/>
letterboxers in the entire country on the same board.  Now that it's <br/>
getting crowded (at least in my opinion), I've wanted to start <br/>
breaking regional information onto regional boards so the main talk <br/>
list doesn't become even more overrun.  California is one of the <br/>
states large enough to be a region on its own, although I'd imagine <br/>
most regional talk lists would cover several states.  (Deep south, <br/>
New England, Southwest, Northwest, etc.)  And when those boards start <br/>
getting too crowded, breaking them up into individual states.  Or in <br/>
the case of California, into sections of the state.  Only create <br/>
boards as they're needed, though.<br/>
<br/>
I'd certainly have thought twice about creating this board had I <br/>
known about the other one, even if it wasn't exactly what I had in <br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
Who is the owner of the Southern California board?  I'm not itching <br/>
to cover the same territory somebody else is already covering, but <br/>
I'd also prefer to have a talk list that covers all of California.  <br/>
And if I could convince him or her to cover all of California instead <br/>
of just Southern California, I'd delete this talk list in a <br/>
heartbeat.  (Sorry, guys!  I'm all for letting other people do the <br/>
work if they want to!)  But if not, I might change the focus to <br/>
Central and Northern California.<br/>

<br/>
Dang! Sorry...didn't mean to cause a ripple, which I seem to have a <br/>
knack for doing lately. I think these boards take on a personality of <br/>
their own and that there is plenty of room for all of them. SoCal <br/>
seems to be a quiet group (kinda like the CT list) whereas this new <br/>
one might take on more the flavor of the PNW group which I see as <br/>
active and fun and positive.<br/>
<br/>
Funny how when you "search" from the yahoogroups home, you don't get <br/>
a really complete list of all the letterbox groups. I tried <br/>
searching "letterbox" and "letterboxing" and got two different lists <br/>
of hits, neither complete. So it's not a surprise that Ryan didn't <br/>
see the SoCal community. There's something for everyone in the <br/>
variety of lists. It's not a problem in my mind, Ryan! Keep up the <br/>
good work. C'mon back to New England sometime soon, dude.<br/>

Eric Polk, aka California Bear is the owner of SoCal group. It was started when you were wearing out your tennies. Incidentally he was the first to complete the mystery box at Crater Lake some time after you took your boat ride there. It took him two tries though. Don<br/>

<br/>
Actually, the SoCal board didn't exist when I did my search, so it's <br/>
DEFINITELY not a surprise that I didn't see the SoCal talk list.  =)  <br/>
I did my search about the same time I created the Pacific Northwest <br/>
board which was in March.  This SoCal board didn't start until August.<br/>
<br/>
And you don't cause trouble, Jay.  *I* seem to be the one that causes <br/>
waves on the talk list!  Everybody loves you!<br/>
<br/>
The other board has to approve membership in the quest to root out <br/>
spam--which it does do--but for those of you worried about it on this <br/>
board....  It was my intention to change the settings to moderate the <br/>
posts of new members--at least until they've made their first post <br/>
and I can make sure it's not spam (or worse!).  But since so many <br/>
people are joining the board at this point and I don't want to turn <br/>
it off individually for everyone one at a time, I figured a couple <br/>
week "grace period" would be appropriate before I turned that <br/>
selection on.<br/>
<br/>
I already changed the Pacific Northwest board to use that feature and <br/>
haven't caught any attempted spammers yet.<br/>
<br/>
Ho ho ho!<br/>

Oh dang!  He found out about the other list!!!  : )<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I sent invites to the people that I knew were in Southern California.  Those people sent invites to others who they knew were in So Cal.  I try to keep an eye on the LBNA list for So Cal boxers but I have been spending a lot of time deleting stuff off that list so I haven't been paying as much attention as I should.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want to send a broadcast about the group because I have seen a couple of people get blasted for advertising other groups on the LBNA group.<br/>

Well, I approved you so you can check out the SoCal group.<br/>

That would be me!  I am OK with having mine be an all California list.  I started it as a So Cal list so that people wouldn't have to spend a lot of time deleting posts about boxes that are 100s of miles away from them.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I have been to a few boxes in No Cal and I know there are a couple of people on the list who live in more than one area of California who probably wouldn't object to having the list be for the whole state.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to change the name of a Yahoo! group after it is created?<br/>

A simple announcement that the talk list exists won't get you blasted <br/>
for anything.  Mentioning it several times a day might do it, but an <br/>
announcement a couple of times a year shouldn't cause anyone undue <br/>
blasting.<br/>

(Stopping after one would be ideal, but since there are always new <br/>
people joining the hobby, an announcement very few months is okay in <br/>
my book.)<br/>

&gt; It was a very nice boat ride, though!<br/>
<br/>
I was there in June and the boats hadn't started running yet.  Half of Rim Drive was closed due to snow.  I went back in September and the boats had already stopped running.  : (  I really wanted to get out to Wizard Island and take some pictures from inside the Crater.  There have been TONS from the rim but I have never seen one from inside the Crater.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any pics from inside the Crater?<br/>

Since I have done my share of blasting, I figured that the blasting needs some explanation. The sites that I questioned were generally alternatives to the LBNA site, and each of them had the data base and locations for letterboxes. Whether it is ez board, which calls themselves Letterboxing North  America,and uses the LBNA patch in their banner head,Steve  of Ravenhaus' site, or the data base site connected to Yahoo , I sent short fuses with the powder. Regional talk lists are quite a different story and I believe the future for talk lists connected to letterboxing. There are no data bases involved and it is just chat.  I think if there should probably be one  California chat list, and since Ryan is running PNW maybe you could handle the new Ca. list?  Or maybe you guys could split the ownership? I do like the method of slowing down the joining so that some spam is eliminated. <br/>

&gt; That would be me!  I am OK with having mine be an all California list.  I started it as <br/>
a So Cal list so that people wouldn't have to spend a lot of time deleting posts about <br/>
boxes that are 100s of miles away from them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it possible to change the name of a Yahoo! group after it is created?<br/>

Although I don't know the mechanism, this is possible.  I only know this because <br/>
another list I'm on spontaneously changed its name one day, and I didn't recognize as <br/>
one of mine on my list at first.<br/>
