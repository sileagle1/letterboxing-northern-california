                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spent some time yesterday in San Francisco sprucing up some of my <br>
boxes.  The Message in the Haunted Mansion series has been dying for <br>
some attention for quite some time and I finally got around to it.  I <br>
have replaced box #1 (the key) and put a HEAVY ROCK on top of it in <br>
hopes that it will not stray again.  Also, I made the decision to go <br>
ahead and remove the logbooks from all the boxes except the last one - <br>
this is a trick I learned in Connecticut for series with lots of boxes. <br>
  It becomes a little repetitive to log in every few minutes, plus this <br>
way I don't have to keep replacing the darn books every 6 months.  This <br>
is a particularly well visited series as evidenced by all the scraps of <br>
paper that folks stuck into the bags because the logbooks were so full!<br>
<br>
I also went to visit the Where the Buffalo Roam as there had been <br>
reports that it could not be found.  The Y-shaped log that marked the <br>
spot has been removed (ack!) so that would explain the difficulties <br>
people are experiencing!  But luckily I knew approximately where the <br>
box used to be and after digging around in the rotting redwood pile I <br>
was able to find it.  So I replanted it nearby and it is ready and <br>
waiting to be found again.  This particular box is quite a magnet for <br>
people traveling through - it has had visitors from all over the <br>
country.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I received an email from a Good Samaritan today about my Crab <br>
Cove box in Alameda.  Apparently he is a local resident and found the <br>
box washed up on shore after the various storms we had around New <br>
Year's.  Luckily he took the time to read the contents of the box and <br>
he didn't throw it out!  As soon as I get it back from him, I will <br>
replant - it sounds like it is time for a new hiding spot for this <br>
hapless box.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone in a couple of weekends<br>
