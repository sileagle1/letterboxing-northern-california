                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
3/4 of Clan Jiggs (Mrs Jiggs STILL recovering from her latest <br/>
surgery) ventured down to San Jose for the Hershey's Chocolate Track <br/>
Meet State Finals (my 9 y/o was in the 400M) and took the <br/>
opportunity to do a "little boxing" on the way. Here's our <br/>
breakdown...<br/>
<br/>
A Rocky Trail - Davis - Strike 2. This is the second time we have <br/>
attempted this "kid friendly" box without success. We found <br/>
the "egg" but still have no clue what shape. size. colour, etc <br/>
the "french bread is!<br/>
<br/>
Horseshoe Park - Berkeley - Toast. We followed the clues (great <br/>
clues too), but sadly, all we found was a young couple locked in the <br/>
throes of passion (where's my water bucket?) a suspicious large <br/>
ziplock bag, and a note stating,"Please do not throw out...etc etc".<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, on the previous bench we did find (sitting in the open!!) <br/>
ANOTHER box...this one the "HOUSE of TREES" box....seeing as how it <br/>
was right next to a garbage can in an area with a few transients <br/>
around, we took the box and have it safely tucked away here! <br/>
<br/>
Onward...<br/>
<br/>
Twisted Candles - Oakland - ??? found the correct starting path, but <br/>
quickly got too turned around to get any further.<br/>
<br/>
Arakun - Oakland - nice, uphill hike, with a great stamp as a <br/>
reward! <br/>
<br/>
Mission City Memorial Park - Santa Clara - what an absolutely <br/>
gorgeous cemetery! Kids just loved this place! Stamp was positively <br/>
fabulous - well worth the trip!<br/>
<br/>
Mission Santa Clara - Santa Clara - another of Sierra Sally's fine <br/>
stamps! We found this one in the dark - no small feat considering we <br/>
had no flashlights (bad LBers, bad...!)<br/>
<br/>
Will update the return trip boxes later.<br/>

LETTERBOXING TEAMS went to Horseshoe Park on Friday to locate this box! <br/>
  Apparently the Jiggses were there at 3:30 and found the remnants of <br/>
the erstwhile box, and we were there at about 7:00 when no traces were <br/>
left.  Coyotl, I'll assume you were there somewheres in between?  <br/>
Wouldn't that have been funny if we'd all converged at the same <br/>
time????<br/>

P.S.  has anyone contacted the placer yet - I don't think he's on this <br/>
list; I was planning to invite him<br/>

While everyone was hunting down urban boxes Jetlag and I were <br/>
strolling Pleasanton Ridge. We finally stamped into box 3 and 4. I <br/>
got tired of waiting for the other boxes to be planted. It's been a <br/>
year now. Not too many folks have ventured out to hunt for these <br/>
lovely boxes. This is a wonderful hike on the ridge with great vistas<br/>
(spectacular on clear days). I was surprised that Ryan hasn't done <br/>
this one. Thank you Coyotl Clan for planting. I'm thinking of <br/>
planting some along the ridge to help motivate you into planting the <br/>
rest of this series. <br/>
For those that do hunt these down, bring a lunch. There are numerous <br/>
picnic tables, and drinking fountains along the trail(I don't mean <br/>
the horses troughs)to refill you water container. <br/>
