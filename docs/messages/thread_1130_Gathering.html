                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I've been waiting to talk to the Boxalots, but our plans have <br/>
seemed to go bump in the rain.<br/>
The Boxalots move to the East Coast this summer (everyone..."Awwwwww!") <br/>
and she is very busy with preparing for a household move, school change, <br/>
etc.  AND on top of that, her husband is deployed to Iraq. <br/>
SO, we hadn't done anymore planning on a Fairfield/Vacaville Gathering <br/>
than throw MANY ideas out there to each other.  We'd still like to do <br/>
one, but time is crunching and I fear we will have to let you down. <br/>
KoolKats?  I'd love to join our efforts with you (when you're able) and <br/>
possibly do one in Davis.  A WONDERFUL boxing opportunity for all, and a <br/>
great place to tour.  I hope the Boxalots Gals can still help and/or attend!<br/>
Well, I'll be thinking on that.<br/>
I've been carving my first series of stamps to place in a park near me <br/>
(Fairfield).  We don't have many here so I thought I'd get busy.  I hope <br/>
to get them out soon, if the rain should EVER stop!<br/>
Happy Keester to all!<br/>
