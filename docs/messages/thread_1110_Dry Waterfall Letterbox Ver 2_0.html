                    <div class="plaintext-content">After recieving feedback from a fellow Letterboxer,  we went out and checked the status of <br/>
the Dry Waterfall Letterbox in Red Rock Canyon.  It appears that the clues were rather too <br/>
"subtle" (to put it nicely) and it remained unfound for 3 years.  This was not our objective for <br/>
this box so we changed its hiding place and rewrote the clues.  This new combination of <br/>
clues and placement should make this a much more rewarding experience for those seeking <br/>
the box.  This  is now listed as a "new" box. <br/>

    a year ago trying to find this box, without luck or any clue as to<br/>
    where we were going wrong.<br/>
