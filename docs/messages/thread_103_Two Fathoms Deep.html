that it is one of my favorite stamps I've ever carved, and as I planted <br/>
it I was thinking how sad it was that no one was ever going to find it <br/>
since it's way out there.  But now I hear that 2 LBers have visited!  <br/>
Hooray!  Thanks for the update<br/>

&gt; ALSO:  Last weekend, we had fun finding Princess Lea's mystery box Two <br/>
&gt; Fathoms Deep.  We were surprised to be only the second to find - <br/>
&gt; folks, you've really got to check this one out.  Excellent stamp and <br/>
&gt; the area is beautiful and full of stuff to do.<br/>
