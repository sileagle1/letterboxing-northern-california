There is a rumor going around that she is already planning to quit <br/>
nursing to become a full-time letterboxer, and do letterbox <br/>
consulting work. <br/>
<br/>
Her first assignment is to chart out and record the history of every <br/>
single one of Dartmoor's boxes while getting Britain to adopt the <br/>
American version of LBing as a parallel. She's scheduled for <br/>
meetings at Buckingham Palace with Her Majesty.<br/>
<br/>
Upon returning to America, she's planning a partnership with Amanda <br/>
from Seattle, to produce a line of LB products and supplies that <br/>
feature an image of Nancy Drew as a logo.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As with all rumors you hear, there are elements of truth and elements <br/>
of pure fancy in Paul's gossip.  The truth is that last Thursday I <br/>
completed the "pre-licensure" part of my program, which means that as <br/>
soon as my teachers turn in my grades I am eligible to sit for the RN <br/>
licensing exam.  And then I can give you all shots legally!  However, I <br/>
still have another year's worth of work to do for the Master's degree <br/>
(and I am going to string it out over 2 years because I AM TIRED).  It <br/>
has been a rigorous 15 months and I am so happy to have lots of time <br/>
available for letterboxing (as soon as Christmas shopping and this cold <br/>
that hit me subside).  Seems like there are an awful lot of boxies out <br/>
there just waiting for me.  Anybody interested in a trip to Hog Heaven?<br/>
<br/>
As a reward to myself for making it through to RN, and to celebrate <br/>
Amanda's "significant" birthday in March, the Nancy Girls are heading <br/>
over to Dartmoor to get the authentic British Letterboxing experience!  <br/>
We are renting a cottage on the actual moors!  I have asked Santa for <br/>
trekking poles so I don't get sucked into any bogs!  We are leaving it <br/>
up to the Green Turtle to meet with the royals - the Nancy Girls have <br/>
already seen and London and have other tasks to accomplish.<br/>
