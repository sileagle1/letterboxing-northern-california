Posted 4 boxes, though one of the mystery boxes is essentially a WOM clue<br/>
that will be posted to my blog later tonight.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Sacramento boxes, Zairabear wrote the clues herself and decided<br/>
to post them today, so look for them around 1:30 after I pick her up from<br/>
school.  We didn't get as many planted (or get to look for) as many boxes as<br/>
we'd planned over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We still have four more to plant this afternoon as well, so I'll post a full<br/>
list of what we got out later tonight.<br/>

letterbox at the giant Monopoly game in San Jose for Aahz's Santa<br/>
Clara County Challenge, and also planted a box in honor of all that<br/>
great Art Deco architecture in Oakland.<br/>
<br/>
Both are suitable for sneaky urban boxers.  Both make me smile, in<br/>
terms of the carving.  The Oakland box has a very pretty hand made<br/>
book, too.<br/>

Are we all going to be bumping into each other this weekend, as we<br/>
hunt for new treasures?<br/>
