<br/>
I've just updated the Patch Poll page to reflect the top 3 vote<br/>
getters for a special runoff vote. Originally we<br/>
were going to wait until midnight tonight but the top 3 were far ahead<br/>
of all of the others so we thought it was more important to spend the<br/>
time voting for the final winner.<br/>
<br/>
This vote will continue this week until noon on this Friday, March<br/>
2nd, when the winner will be declared.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all who sent in their designs. This group did a great job<br/>
in representing all the best that CA boxing has to offer. And thanks<br/>
for allowing us to be a part of your patch finding process!<br/>
