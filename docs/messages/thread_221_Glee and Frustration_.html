                    <div class="plaintext-content">Grumpy recently retired and moved with Grinch from New Hampshire to <br/>
Lodi, Ca.  We have been letterboxing for three weeks, in hopes of <br/>
spending time outdoors, keeping fit, and enjoying the hunt for <br/>
boxes.  We have been moderately successful, locating 32 boxes and <br/>
one hitchhiker.  But the frustrations are equally pressing!  We have <br/>
spent several hours searching nearly every inch of Natomas Oaks Park <br/>
on two occasions, without finding the box there.  And yesterday we <br/>
picked up the three trailside boxes in Oakdale before hitting a <br/>
brick wall at Grinding Rock State Park in Jackson.  We're pretty <br/>
sure we found the correct location at Grinding Rock, but funhog's <br/>
box was no where to be found.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has found either of these boxes recently, we'd love to <br/>
know about it.  The Natomas Oaks one particularly has us stumped.  <br/>
If you have any suggestions for us, without telling us its location, <br/>
please send us a personal email.  The joy of boxing is wonderful.  <br/>
The frustrations, however, are making even me feel grumpy.<br/>
