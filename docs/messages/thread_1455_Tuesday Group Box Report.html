                    <div class="plaintext-content">Renee pretty much covered it.  One thing she did neglect to mention was<br>
the key piece of information we learned about CarBoxing: be careful<br>
where you stamp when you're the driver.  Since Dos Piedras was just on<br>
the side of the road, we stamped sitting in the car.  Unfortunately,<br>
Renee, as the driver, stamped on the closest flat surface available to<br>
her, her steering wheel, & scared us half to death when she honked the<br>
horn.<br>
 <br>
Lea & I did get Salute to Vallejo & there was the hitchhiker Druid<br>
Talisman: Protection in it.  It was a very cool little stamp, mounted on<br>
string that had a couple of beads on it & was attached to it's logbook.<br>
We then "found" one of Lea's mystery boxes nearby (meaning & had half<br>
solved the clues & Lea took me the rest of the way).<br>
 <br>
Lea then went home & I went on to Glen Ellen.  I had Words to the Wise<br>
in my hands, but then got kicked out of the Bentzinger Winery because<br>
they were closing.  The employee that did the "kicking" went back to the<br>
main office, so I quickly stamped in, but I'm pretty sure she watching<br>
me the whole time so I think saw me put it back.  I know at least one<br>
person at the Winery has given permission for the box to be there, so I<br>
hope that was her.<br>
 <br>
I ended up counting 16 boxes plus the hitchhiker.  Thanks for all the<br>
boxing fun.<br>

<br>
	Hi Lisa,<br>
	<br>
	I'm sure Lea will give the full scoop. She's quite the sight<br>
when<br>
	she's in full gear!! <br>
	<br>
	We managed to talk her into a short lunch break at Whole Foods. <br>
	<br>
	It was a beautiful day in the North Bay.<br>
	<br>
	I hit the "Say Cheese!" box at the Marin French Cheese Factory<br>
in<br>
	Novato on my way up. Nils (Black Cavalier) and I ran into each<br>
other<br>
	at "You & Me" in Petaluma where we had to do some excavation.<br>
The<br>
	fallen tree trunk under which the letterbox hides had split and<br>
a large<br>
	portion was on the box. We couldn't lift the piece, so we did a<br>
bit of<br>
	excavation. We also nabbed Riverwalk before meeting up with Lea<br>
and<br>
	Cathie (Mimulus).<br>
	<br>
	I drove, Lea navigated and we nabbed something like 2 boxes per<br>
hour<br>
	(Nils, ever the engineer calculated our rate). There were 2<br>
missing<br>
	boxes (Harry you've got mail and G-9 summit) and one pretty lame<br>
	store-bought stamp that had nothing to do with the name of the<br>
box<br>
	(Foghorn Leghorns). <br>
	<br>
	The two Sam Spade boxes at Petaluma Adobe by OBJuan were of<br>
course<br>
	great. There were 5th grade "ants" everywhere. A school group<br>
was<br>
	arriving to camp overnight at the adobe and the students were a<br>
trail<br>
	of ants carrying their gear up the trail to the adobe. Mim, Nils<br>
and I<br>
	took turns running interference while Lea nabbed the box. Both<br>
great<br>
	stamps. <br>
	<br>
	This is where we stopped for lunch, after which Mimulus headed<br>
out to<br>
	other errands. Nils, Lea and I continued on.<br>
	<br>
	From there to Finches Turtle--a Carbox if ever there was one.<br>
These<br>
	folks are from Virginia and this is a cute little box. Next to<br>
Leghorn<br>
	Park and the aforementioned highly disappointing Foghorn<br>
Leghorn's. <br>
	This box probably won't last long due to lack of camoflauge and<br>
the<br>
	high traffic location. <br>
	<br>
	Then to Two Rock Valley for TWO stamps commemorating the<br>
prominent<br>
	features of this valley. The first in a cemetary (Friendly<br>
Valley),<br>
	where Lea noted in the logbook "I see dead people". Very near by<br>
is a<br>
	carbox "Dos Piedras". Both nice, handcarved stamps.<br>
	<br>
	Then to Little Shop of Horrors, one of Mimulus' letterboxes.<br>
This is<br>
	also an easy driveby, with a great stamp. (And a port-a-potty<br>
nearby! <br>
	This is critical since Lea makes stops only for letterboxes and<br>
Nils<br>
	and I agreed that biological functions take precident over<br>
	letterboxes!)<br>
	<br>
	We then nabbed another Mimulus box. This one is the Holy Canoli,<br>
	Batman! mystery box. From your profile I know that you've found<br>
this<br>
	one, so I can say that the location is my all-time favorite<br>
letterbox<br>
	spot. (And I'm fundamentally a hiker who boxes, so typically I<br>
look<br>
	for the long walk.) This is a unique spot--I appreciate art in<br>
it's<br>
	various forms (including the gazillion lines painted on the<br>
stage....to<br>
	cite your blog).<br>
	<br>
	On to the Gravenstein Special. We were first finders. I don't<br>
know<br>
	how long this one will last, but it is an easy walk, wheelchair<br>
	accessible. Pretty spot, but watch out for slackers! We had to<br>
dodge<br>
	groups of kids from the nearby high school. Cute stamp with some<br>
great<br>
	history. <br>
	<br>
	Then we made a stop for the Dudley's Been Kidnapped bonus box,<br>
which is<br>
	a mystery location. I can tell you that the prior stamps contain<br>
	information that leads you to where Snidley is holding Dudley<br>
captive. <br>
	Was pretty funny! <br>
	<br>
	My absolute favorite box of the day was (not surprisingly)<br>
artTrekker's<br>
	Round Barn. Another easy drive by. From car to the spot is<br>
uneven<br>
	terrain and at least 50 yards, but easy enough to nab the box<br>
and run<br>
	back to the car. Great stamp. I wish I had made a second imprint<br>
to<br>
	add to my collection of framed favorites (some of yours are<br>
among the<br>
	postage-stamp sized gallery along one hall of my house). <br>
	<br>
	From there, we headed back to the Golden Eagle Shopping Center<br>
in<br>
	Petaluma where I parted ways with Nils and Lea. They were<br>
heading<br>
	towards Glen Ellen and Sonoma. I needed to head home for some<br>
much<br>
	needed hubby maintance.<br>
	<br>
	So, in 6 hours we nabbed 11 letterboxes. Two missing. I didn't<br>
make<br>
	additional stops on my way home--I was exhausted. I'm not sure<br>
what<br>
	else Lea found, I see the Salute to Vallejo on her profile.<br>
	<br>
	We talked a bit about the upcoming gathering and some of the<br>
traveling<br>
	event stamps that have already shown up. I think I could spend<br>
an<br>
	additional day in the North Bay anytime soon. <br>
	<br>
	So, that's the scoop. I'm sure Lea will post to LbNCA soon with<br>
the<br>
	official report.<br>
	<br>
	Cheers,<br>
	Renee<br>
