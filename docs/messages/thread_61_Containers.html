For in town letterboxes we have used many empty plastic peanut butter jars. I clean them out VERY well and have yet to lose one to critters. Round Altoids tins make great micro boxes if you glue on some magnets and large pill containers also work ok.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have yet to find a 'perfect' container for a letterbox.  For <br/>
microboxes, I've found film cannisters word very well.  They tend to <br/>
be very waterproof as long as the cap was put on tight, so I don't <br/>
even use Ziplocks on them.  Even when they're in the elements.<br/>
<br/>
Larger containers....  dollar stores are a great place for cheap <br/>
ones.  Some keep out the elements better than others, but I haven't <br/>
found any that do a perfect job of it.  Those that are more-or-less <br/>
clear with the white lid do a relatively bad job of keeping water <br/>
out, but are sturdy enough to last for a long, long time.  The flimsy <br/>
Ziplock containers keep water out really well--at least until they <br/>
crack which they tend to do after a little wear and tear.<br/>
<br/>
The more boxes you'll find, the more ideas you'll get and a better <br/>
idea of how different containers work at keeping out the elements and <br/>
standing up to wear and tear.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Old VHS cassette tape containers (preferrably black or brown ones) <br/>
with their internal cassette 'hooks' filed off.  I purchase them in <br/>
bulk from the Boeing Surplus Yard near Seattle for about $0.10 each <br/>
(look through the phone book for other 'industrial' surplus yards in <br/>
your area--these tapes were excess training tapes that Boeing uses <br/>
to train their myriad employees).  I then use zippered plastic <br/>
freezer bags and double wrap the logbook, stamp &amp; pen.  These seem <br/>
to hold up fairly well and they're often well-camouflaged.  My other <br/>
containers of choice are the 35mm film canisters and the <br/>
smallish 'dim sum' platic containers you can purchase at Asian <br/>
markets.  Sometimes I wrap the various containers with camouflaged <br/>
or electric tape to camouflage them in their various elements.  <br/>
Other times I spray paint them black.  I've also found some great <br/>
tupperware or rubbermaid containers at thrift stores that work <br/>
incredibly well &amp; you sure can't beat the price!  My experience has <br/>
been that the tupperware containers seem to be the most 'waterproof' <br/>
of the various plasticware on the market.  I've used all sorts of <br/>
containers ranging from the hamburger patty to the onion half to the <br/>
regular sandwich tupperware containers.  They all seem to survive <br/>
the many seasons quite well.  I've also come across small <br/>
canning/mason jars that other letterboxers have used for <br/>
letterboxes.  They seem to work rather well, too.<br/>
