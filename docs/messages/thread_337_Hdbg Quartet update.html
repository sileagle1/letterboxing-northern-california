Oh my goodness.  I am not sure if we were the last to find it, since I tottally forgot to send the placer a e-mail saying we did.  We found the Quartet Oct 31, 2004.  Jeff put in in as well as he could and he made sure that it was hidden well and didn't fall out.  Actually we went back a little later and didn't see anything suspicous.  All was quite.  I am sorry to hear about this and I hope we didn't cause this mishap.  I would feel awful if it was our fault.  WE did however enjoy our day in HB and doing the Quartet.  Thanks.   P.S.  Still waiting to hear if there is going to be a Stamp shindig and when.  I have my pic all lined up and ready to start my carving.  It seems the subject blew away with the wind.....<br>
