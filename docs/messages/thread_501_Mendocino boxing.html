I'm rather new to this Northern California group. Can anyone recommend  <br/>
letterboxes in the Mendocino/Fort Bragg area? I have a friend who is new to  boxing <br/>
who will be up there soon. He just got back from Maui and was  disappointed <br/>
in searching diligently for three boxes there and coming up  empty... So it <br/>
would be nice to recommend some to him that are actually known to  be in their <br/>
place! <br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Tonny <br/>

This might be shameless bragging but we've gotten great reviews for our "St. <br/>
Patrick's Series" in Mendocino and Ft. Bragg. These 5 stamps take you to some <br/>
beautiful spots. There's also one at the Chapel at Sea Ranch that's recently <br/>
been found and "Gift in the Redwoods" 18 miles west of the coast on hwy 20.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you go for them and get them!<br/>
