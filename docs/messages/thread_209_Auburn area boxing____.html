                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! A very hot day of boxing. Hot, but productive. The<br/>
Letterboxspector family, with Special K, went after four boxes. Having<br/>
heard of the trouble finding the "Wide Window" box by Lemony Snicket<br/>
we allowed only three hours to look for this box. Unfortunately we<br/>
found this box and all the misery that goes with it. Next off to old<br/>
town Auburn. So glad to see the Old Auburn Letterbox back. We hunted<br/>
this one several times, with no luck. I wonder why? While we were<br/>
there we had to get the North Fork Dry Diggins. This log book is<br/>
nearly full. Last on our hit list is the elusive I-80 series box #1.<br/>
We have been one step behind Doublesaj and Old blue on this one many<br/>
times. But today we got it! This log book is nearly full also.<br/>
<br/>
O.K. The kids, "On the hunt", "Box hopper", and "Special K" all want<br/>
to go swimming. I guess we will go home now. Thanks for all the boxing<br/>
fun today!<br/>
