Are you back in rainy Northern California?  Do you care to share any <br/>
of your adventures in the Moors with us?  How was the Great Grimpen <br/>
Mire?  Did you hear the baying of a spectral hound? Or was that just <br/>
the sound of Ryan and Amanda "burping" tupperware?<br/>

We did hope to plant a Hound of the Baskervilles box out at the "Great Grimpen Mire" only <br/>
to discover that this place does not exist.  It is an amalgam of various mires of Dartmoor, <br/>
although Fox Tor Mire is considered the closest in description.  We had intentions of going <br/>
to Fox Tor, but the rain dashed our plans (it's bad enough in the mires when things are <br/>
dry!)  So we ended up leaving the box at the cottages where we stayed.  <br/>
<br/>
The moors are very atmospheric and when the fog rolls in, you can see how the place got <br/>
its reputation for spookiness.  There were some interesting sounds heard as the wind <br/>
whipped through the tors - I supposed it sounded like an anguished dog!  <br/>
