to Canada yesterday. He found another one in that box named, All Those That<br/>
Wander Are Not Lost. He gave it a free ticket to California and it will<br/>
eventually be planted around here. That stamp has been around. It looks like<br/>
that may not have even been it's original name. Someone found it without a<br/>
logbook in FL awhile back and made one for it.<br/>
