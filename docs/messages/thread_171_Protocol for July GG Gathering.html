<br/>
I am very new to this and look foward to the gathering in July as it <br/>
will be my first.  What's the scoop?  It sounds like the challenge is <br/>
to hide a letterbox somewhere in the park before the event and the <br/>
clues are revealed at the picnic?  Or they get posted and we try to <br/>
find them before the gathering so we can laugh over them later?  OR is <br/>
it some sort of cooperative group hunt?<br/>
<br/>
Please advise.<br/>
<br/>
ALso, I have just planted 8 new boxes in Sonoma COunty, check it out.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the 31st, <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The planning committee is going to attempt to meet next Thursday and <br/>
make some general plans for the day.  Number one priority will be <br/>
exactly where to have the event in the large expanse of Golden Gate <br/>
Park!  We did something similar last year at Kennedy Grove in Richmond <br/>
so we sort of know what to expect, but really these things tend to take <br/>
on a life of their own.<br/>
<br/>
As near as I can tell, there are no real rules here - you could plant <br/>
boxes beforehand and just bring clues on the day of, or you could post <br/>
the clues earlier (but please do bring copies with you on the day as <br/>
well).  If anyone is planning on planting some boxes in the park, <br/>
please let me know beforehand so I can drum up enthusiasm based on the <br/>
lure of "XX number of boxes to be found."  At the San Luis Obispo <br/>
gathering people hunted in "packs" with their friends or families but <br/>
it is not a competition or anything.  They had boxes planted in their <br/>
park for just the one day, but I am envisioning permanent boxes for GGP <br/>
(although this is not mandatory of course).  Also, there is a lot of <br/>
sitting around the picnic table, exchanging stamps, looking through <br/>
each others' books and swapping trail stories.<br/>
<br/>
The park is very large and I am thinking about recommending bringing <br/>
bicycles the get around more easily.  Paul has also indicated that he'd <br/>
like to have some kind of planned activities for newbies - he is <br/>
planning on inviting some friends of his who have shown some interest <br/>
in letterboxing but not really been exposed to it yet.  Probably we'll <br/>
have some coals and a BBQ going if anyone wants to bring something to <br/>
grill.  DoubleSaj may feel compelled to bring a cake again.  We will <br/>
attempt a group photo.   Hope this all gives you a better idea of what <br/>
to expect, and more details will follow!<br/>
