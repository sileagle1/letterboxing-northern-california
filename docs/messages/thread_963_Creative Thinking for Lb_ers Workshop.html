As part of my job at Schwab, I teach a class on Creative Thinking and Problem Solving. I cover some fun techniques that get people to think outside of the framework they're used to, thereby solving problems or seeing new possibilities. It's great for generating new ideas.<br>
<br>
I'd like to adapt and shorten my class, and present a workshop on Creative Letterboxes -- focused on thinking differently to create boxes with new themes and ideas, and novel formats. We'd work through some exercises as a group, and we'd walk away with a number of new ideas and ways to come up with more.<br>
<br>
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED?<br>
<br>
I'm considering having the workshop in January, indoors, at some place such as a cafe's back room or a similar venue here in San Francisco. It'd run about 2 1/2 - 3 hours, with social time afterwards.<br>
<br>
I'd run the workshop for as few as 5 people, but we could probably have a group of up to 15.<br>
<br>
PLEASE LET ME KNOW if you're seriously interested. E-mail me with any questions you have.<br>
<br>
Thanks! <br>
<br>
Happy Thanksgiving to ALL my wonderful letterboxing colleagues!<br>
