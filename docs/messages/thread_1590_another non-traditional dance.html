<br/>
Sorry I have been so out of touch...it has been a BUSY summer for me.<br/>
Lots of work, and traveling for trade shows, and training to hike<br/>
Mt. Whitney, which I did at the beginning of the week. FABULOUS!!!<br/>
No, we did not do it in one day (I do not need my head examined). We<br/>
backpacked up to Trail Camp on Monday, hiked to the summit on Tuesday,<br/>
backpacked back down on Wed. It's too beautiful up there not to stay<br/>
a night or two. We were blessed with gorgeous weather and safety, and<br/>
met many nice folks on the trail. I looked in vain for "Bachelor Bob's<br/>
Dilemma", the clues for which are oriented to the solar potty that is<br/>
no longer there. It would have been nice to add a high-altitude Lb to<br/>
all the other joys of this trip, but it was easy to let go of, as well.<br/>
I had wanted to prepare one to plant, but just did not have the time.<br/>
Guess I'll have to go up there again. (Oh, btw, would love to never have<br/>
to "go" up there again...the new alternative to the solar potty is a<br/>
"wag bag", and, though I consider myself pretty earthy, that got to be<br/>
a bit much to take!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm chomping at the bit to get Paul's curiosities, but still can't get<br/>
down there quite yet. Loved the non-traditional square dance, and had to<br/>
share this non-traditional dance with you all as well. I just know you'll<br/>
appreciate it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHEC-tm4DCA&amp;mode=related&amp;search=<br/>
First saw it on 60 Minutes several years ago. But now it's a YouTube world!!<br/>
<br/>
I won't be able to make the American River Gathering, so y'all have  <br/>
fun for me,<br/>
and I'll look forward to seeing you somewhere out on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
aT (who noticed this week that her backpack is an REI Trekker!!! and will<br/>
have to embroider "ART" on there, just for kicks)<br/>
