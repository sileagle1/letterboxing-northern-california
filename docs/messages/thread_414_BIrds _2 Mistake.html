Thanks to the helpful advice of Blackbird, I see their is a mistake <br/>
in the BIrds #2 clues (The first letter of licnese plate, not the <br/>
second).  It has been fised on teh website, but if print out clues <br/>
to solve later, then you may want ot go back and change it.  Sorry <br/>
for the dyslexia!  <br/>
<br/>
I had a wonderful time visiting with you all and I am bummed I did <br/>
not hang out longer so I could have gone with LEa nd Cool Cats to <br/>
MOMA, I went on my own at dusk and was intimidated by the homeless <br/>
residents, so I left.  I was trying to get home to have dinner with <br/>
my family (Pan fried chicken, yummy) and ironically I missed the 580 <br/>
turn off and had to go thru SF which added 30 minutes to the trip!  <br/>
<br/>
It is owndrful to have faces conenected with the names on this <br/>
list....what wonderful carvings!  PS&gt;  If you have granite <br/>
countertops or even just a piece of polished stone, the carving <br/>
medium slides wonderfully over it (as opposed to wood tabletop) for <br/>
ease of carving curves.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
