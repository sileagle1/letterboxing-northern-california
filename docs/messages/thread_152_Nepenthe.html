have to set aside some weekend to get to these really cool sounding <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Nepenthe is worth the trip! The stamp is really great, and the spot <br/>
is so enjoyable. I was lucky - there were a bunch of people around, <br/>
but they all left when I got to the spot. When I left some other <br/>
people started to arrive, so my timing was perfect! I also had a lot <br/>
of fun figuring out the clues - the first quarter of my ancient lit <br/>
class came in handy! Great box, Paul! I can't wait to do your other <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to plant my first box sometime this week at San Jose State <br/>
Univ. I'll post clues as soon as the box is ready for visiters!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the great message about Nepenthe - it thrills me that so many people are enjoying it. That's what gives me energy to plant more interesting and unusual letterboxes. I'm working on a few fairly complicated ones at the same time right now, and I wouldn't do all this work if I didn't think people would be enriched in some way by the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your words of encouragement, and I look forward to seeing your letterboxes in San Jose soon.<br/>
