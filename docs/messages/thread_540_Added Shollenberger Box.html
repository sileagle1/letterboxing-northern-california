Another box has been added to Shollenberger Park, Petaluma as of<br>
today. It's a 2-sided stamp, too.  Although the bird migrations<br>
haven't really started yet, there's certainly a lot of wildlife energy<br>
going on between winter storms!<br>
<br>
When planting today, there were 3 pairs of Tundra Swans, two of whom<br>
decided to take to flight right near me--what a wooshing sound!  And a<br>
peregrine falcon showed up, majorly upsetting the many birds trying to<br>
eat a bit before the rains started.  Quite a lot of excitement in the<br>
wetlands this morning!<br>
<br>
The new box is now listed on Atlas Quest.  It'll be updated on LBNA as<br>
soon as I can figure out why my password suddenly doesn't work! <br>
Hopefully, this evening or tomorrow.<br>
