the game, and for giving away the location of Brandy's and my letterboxes.  Also, I got an <br/>
email from the pal of the woman mentioned in the article (encountered by Lisa &amp; Robb on <br/>
the trail yesterday) and plan to try and contact the newbies that way.  I may even ask to <br/>
have letterboxing removed from that preschool's list of activities.  I don't have an <br/>
objection to kids finding letterboxes as long as the parents understand that the ADULTS <br/>
should be in charge of rehiding.  If they are just in it for the hunt, I say geocaching is more <br/>
rewarding for the kids.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Robb and I had an interesting experience whilst letterboxing on Bay <br/>
Farm Island this weekend.  We were "waiting out" a photographer, <br/>
before we rehid a letterbox, when along came a couple of moms and a <br/>
couple of kids.  One mom was holding a piece of paper in her hand <br/>
and loudly reading clues for anyone to hear.  <br/>
<br/>
Robb and I immediately identified ourselves at letterboxers, and got <br/>
them chatting so we could pump them for information.  Sure enough, <br/>
they had read the article in the Chronicle, and were out on their <br/>
first treasure hunt.  <br/>
<br/>
You know all those things that we worried about?  Well, as nice as <br/>
these folks were, they exemplified our concerns.  When I offered to <br/>
show them the hiding spot, the moms had me speak to their five year <br/>
old, because, they told me proudly, "He's our hider!"  EEEEEK!<br/>
<br/>
Robb and I cheerfully mentioned some of the niceties of letterbox re-<br/>
planting, and probably told them more than they wanted to hear.<br/>
<br/>
Backtracking on the path, we found a ziplock style bag of the exact <br/>
style that was used in the boxes in this series.  Conicidentce?  I <br/>
dunno....This wasn't your standard food baggie.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to check the nearest letterbox, but it was being sat on by <br/>
a couple having an Long Relationship Conversation.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the photo in the article goes....I really don't think that <br/>
it is such a total give-away.  After all there are an awful lot of <br/>
trees near the Conservatory of Flowers...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I, too, started letterboxing with the kids (son &amp; nieces) after reading an article- this one was in a Family Fun magazine in the spring.  While we are a more noticable group than a lone boxer, we are usually in parks &amp; such where we don't stand out too much.  We also have a rule that only I can retrieve &amp; rehide the box (I let them figure out clues enroute, but as we near the location it becomes my job) and we must move away from the area to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
  That being said, I had a hard situation letterboxing last week-  I had made sure the kids were well away from the hiding spot when I went back to rehide.  While I was down the side of the hill replanting, though, a few teenagers rode up (fast!) across the way.  I know they couldn't see what I was doing or where I hid the box, but there was only one way back up the hill due to brush, so there was no way to avoid having them see me come up.  I don't think they paid me any mind (probably thought I was just down at the creek), but I am wondering if there is a standard operating procedure in these situations?  I let the owner know there is a busy riding area nearby (it is actually a construction area, I think, so might not have been there when the box was planted), but didn't know if I should have done something else too.   <br/>
<br/>
  Any suggestions?<br/>
