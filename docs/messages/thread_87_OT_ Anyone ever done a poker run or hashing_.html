                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was looking at a list of other stashing games and came across some <br>
links for poker runs and hashing. I'm wondering if these could be <br>
adapted for letterboxing or maybe an activity at a gathering.<br>
<br>
In a poker run you travel by boat (or other vehicle) to various <br>
checkpoints and pick up a card sealed in an envelope. At the end of <br>
the run you see who's got the best hand. I thought maybe cards could <br>
be stashed with a letterbox or maybe the stamps are cards.<br>
<br>
Hashers describe themselves as a drinking club with a running <br>
problem. One or two people (the hares) take off first leaving <br>
a "scent" for the rest of the group (the hounds) to follow. It can <br>
be strips of paper dropped here and there. Others use flour or chalk <br>
to mark the trail. The trick is that the hares can lead you down <br>
false trails and you have to back track to get back on the scent. <br>
The trail usually ends at a pub or a BBQ in a park somewhere. I'm <br>
still puzzling how this might work for letterboxing but it sounds <br>
like fun. hmm...maybe it's because there's beer at the end.<br>
<br>
Anyone ever tried a poker run or hashing?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In our 'pre-children' lives, my husband and I regularly participated <br>
in hash-harrier runs.  It is sort of like letterboxing but with a <br>
group of people, limited clues (sort of like blazes for a trail) and <br>
no letterbox at the end of the run--instead a big drinking fest, <br>
provided you find the correct trail (as it's littered with false <br>
leads along the way).  It comes with a bunch of rules--similar to <br>
letterboxing (trail names, a trail/path to follow, false leads along <br>
the way, 'experts' in the hobby and newbie welcoming 'traditions') <br>
and is frought with British pub style activities--drinking seemed to <br>
be the capstone event of every hash run.  I'm not a drinker (I <br>
really only like Port, Brandy, cheap sweet wine or good German beer <br>
that requires chewing) ;) so I never really got into that portion of <br>
the hobby--I was in it for the exercise (figuring out the correct <br>
trail sort of encouraged me to not THINK it was exercise while we <br>
were running along trying to catch the rabbit before he got to <br>
the 'end'.  DH, on the other hand, brews his own beer, and really <br>
ENJOYED that part of the hobby but wasn't into the run all that <br>
much.  Looking back, I sort of describe letterboxing as 'hashing' <br>
without the 'rabbit', group of beer drinking buddies and party at <br>
the end.<br>
<br>
HASHING:  The premise of it (as I interpreted it at the time we <br>
participated in it about 10 years ago) seemed to be:  get a group of <br>
folks together at an assigned place, assigned time--launch <br>
a 'rabbit' who knew/set the 'true trail' leading to the ultimate <br>
destination (i.e. beer drinking locale)--he'd blaze a trail with <br>
flour/toilet paper/chalk/other non-permanent substance and then <br>
throw in lots of 'false leads' along the way.  The main body (group <br>
of remaining hashers) would start 5, 10, or 15 minutes behind <br>
the 'rabbit' with the goal of trying to catch the 'rabbit' before he <br>
made it to the desired destination (read beer drinking locale).  If <br>
the 'rabbit' gets to the destination without the main body catching <br>
him, the group would all have to buy him rounds of beer.  If the <br>
main body caught the 'rabbit' before he reached the final <br>
destination, then he would have to buy the entire group a round of <br>
beer.  So, either way, a lot of beer drinking goes on!  There are a <br>
bunch of other 'rules' that one learns along the way--such as an <br>
entire new vocabulary and other 'odd' stuff but this is sort of the <br>
gist of the hobby.<br>
<br>
What appealed to me about letterboxing was the fact that I wasn't <br>
restricted to a certain time of the week to participate, I could <br>
bring the family along, see something new, learn some history in the <br>
process, proceed at our own pace (we love to stop and study things <br>
along the way) and not have that 'peer pressure' to drink that <br>
seemed to go hand in hand with the hash runs (not something I wanted <br>
my 'youngins' to see quite so soon in life).  I also got a bit <br>
scared when we followed a 'true' hash-trail that jumped a rancher's <br>
fence in Texas--home of 'you can shoot 'em if they cross your fence <br>
without askin' questions and you're good by the sheriff'.  Well, <br>
fortunately, the rancher took the time to ask questions before <br>
firin' off his sawed off shotgun and we quickly got off his property <br>
without bloodshed--that was enough to make us reconsider the hobby.  <br>
I didn't care much for the rattlesnakes there, either.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you could incorporate the two hobbies together--instead of <br>
the beer drinking binge at the end, the goal would be finding the <br>
letterbox.  It may have to be a 'time sensitive' type of a box <br>
depending upon which type of true & false trails you blaze leading <br>
to it.  <br>
<br>
I think it's funny--since we started letterboxing about 2 years ago, <br>
every time I see tell-tale evidence of a hash-run along a trail, I <br>
sort of chuckle about it wondering where the 'party' was!  <br>
<br>
POKER RUN:  As for the poker run--the first I heard about it was at <br>
a recent geoclaching event near home a few weeks ago.  I was there <br>
to retrieve a letterbox stamp of mine that somehow ended up in <br>
the 'geocash' system about 100 miles from its 'residential <br>
letterbox'.  One kind geocacher noticed that it appeared to be <br>
letterbox component (since the park's name was written on the <br>
stamp!!!) and made arrangements to get it back to me.  It just <br>
happened to be at the beginning of the big area 'geocache' poker <br>
run.  They, in essence, put 'special codes' in each area geocache.  <br>
There was a list of about 30 geocaches participating in the event <br>
that was handed out to the attendants after they paid their <br>
$5/participant entry fee.  They set off at noon and then had plans <br>
to link back up at 6pm at a local restaurant.  The folks with the <br>
most 'codes' in hand upon entering the restaurant would be handed <br>
playing cards--based on their resulting hands, they played a round <br>
of poker.  He with the best hand(s) won various prizes.  Of course <br>
it was all geocaching items purchased via the geocaching website <br>
(sweatshirts, tshirts, caps, bumper stickers, etc).  I'm sure you <br>
could incorporate this sort of concept into letterboxing, too.  It <br>
just looks like a WHOLE BUNCH of work!<br>
<br>
Personally, though, I'm not that intrigued by 'speed racing' to <br>
various letterboxes because I would certainly miss out on what is so <br>
special about each letterbox venue. I'm sure there are others out <br>
there, though, who would enjoy it.  I'm also one of <br>
those 'competitive types' who is trying my hardest to get away from <br>
being so competitive--hence my affinity for letterboxing.  I do, <br>
however, enjoy meeting other letterboxers and would probably <br>
participate in such an event nonetheless just to interact with other <br>
folks who share a similar passion for this neat hobby.<br>
