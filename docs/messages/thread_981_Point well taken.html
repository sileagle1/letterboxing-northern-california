who pursue this hobby, I feel that offering<br/>
information regarding consumption of a product which<br/>
is commonly used by myself (and perhaps all of us) is<br/>
helpful thing.  I appreciate knowing the impact of my<br/>
consumption and strongly feel that "voting with my<br/>
dollars" really can make a difference;  I would not<br/>
have known about this company's policies without<br/>
Paul's post.  There is nothing offensive here, just<br/>
some information which people can take or leave.  If<br/>
something like this causes a flame war in our group<br/>
(not likely on the LBNCA list I hope...) so be it---<br/>
we're all grownups and it can be handled.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>
