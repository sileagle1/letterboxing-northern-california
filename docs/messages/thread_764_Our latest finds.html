weekend?)...FANTASTIC!  IT sounds like you had a good time.  Di dyou <br>
check out the poetryhouse at Paradise Ridge?<br>
<br>
I just planted my last box for a while...an easy drive by but you do <br>
have to watch the movie Pollyanna, so it may or may not be so easy <br>
depending on your toelrance for 60's Disney films.  <br>
<br>
The cool cats were extra cool and dropped off some wonderful korean <br>
tupperware and camo tape and I turned them on to some good mosquito <br>
repellent (DEET free) called Buzz Away citronella towelettes.  Not <br>
sure how they would work in Alaska or the BOundary waters where <br>
mosquitos are like birds, but on two occasions they have prevented me <br>
form getting bitten when others were.<br>
