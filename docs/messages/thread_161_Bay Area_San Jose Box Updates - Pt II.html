<br>
Here's what the Jiggs clan was up to on Saturday...<br>
<br>
Alum Rock Park - San Jose - Wow! My kids loved this park! Who'd a <br>
thunk, with the sulphur smells and brackish water and... Great <br>
stamp, with lots of visitors...area's begging for a second stanp!!!<br>
<br>
Alameda Creek Trail - Fremont - we took Lizardbutt's advise and <br>
shunned the cities in favour of this graet 4 mile stroll along the <br>
east bay! The boxes were all there, with some really great clues to <br>
go with them! A word to the wise..read ALL of the clue..it'll save <br>
you backtracking three or 4 times, like it did us! Definitely a <br>
great, kid-friendly (the kids took their scooters!) series.<br>
<br>
Sushi House - Alameda - a trip to this area wouldn't be complete <br>
without picking up at least one of Princess Lea's LBs! This one is <br>
in a neat spot on the waterfront! We were first finders too (of the <br>
second book). Of note, the Sushi House restaurant is moving..but it <br>
really wont affect the clues that much, as it'll be that much closer <br>
to the hiding spot!<br>
<br>
Again, if anyone knows who was in the process of planting the HOUSE <br>
of TREES box in Berkelry, plmk, as I have the box here.<br>
