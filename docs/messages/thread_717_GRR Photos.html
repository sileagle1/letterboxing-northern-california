<br/>
I've put the group photos that Sierra Sally e-mailed me in the photos<br/>
section, and concilidated all of the photos into a single GRR folder.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed when I went to upload the photos, that it said 25.x<br/>
megabytes (out of a 30 megabyte quota) were already full! If anyone<br/>
else has photos to upload but it gets rejected due to the quota, let<br/>
me know and I'll start shrinking some of the photos already in there<br/>
so they don't take up so much space. I'll leave them be for now, though.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

Can't you read the nametags everyone is wearing? I'll be the sole<br/>
exception because, well, I don't like to make it easy for anyone to<br/>
remember. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
But seriously.... identifying everybody is a challenge even if you<br/>
attended the event. It's hard to remember who goes with which name<br/>
when you meet 50+ people in quick succession!<br/>
<br/>
Let's see how I do....  =)<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna rename some of the pictures to make identifying them easier.<br/>
<br/>
Picture #1: Starting from the far left and going clockwise: Doublesaj,<br/>
Mimulus, Not Sure, ArtTrekker, Wascally Wabbit, Flower<br/>
<br/>
Picture #2: From left to right: Mimulus, Flower, ArtTrekker<br/>
<br/>
Picture #3: Old Blue, Doublesaj, and Cellissimo<br/>
<br/>
Picture #4: From left to right around the table: Charlene, Red in SF,<br/>
Can't see who's behind Red, Sierra Sally,  Lisa Scenic (I think!),<br/>
Black Cavalies, and Cellissimo<br/>
<br/>
Picture #5: That's me in the sunglasses talking to... shoot.... Mutau<br/>
Paul? <br/>
<br/>
Picture #6: Rainbow Girl on the left, Lil' Bear on the right<br/>
<br/>
Picture #7: From left to right: Wascally Wabbit, Flower, and someone<br/>
who will likely never forgive me for forgetting their trailname!<br/>
<br/>
Picture #8: From left to right, starting with the headless person in<br/>
the striped shirt: Carol of the Da Kool Kats, Carol's better half of<br/>
Da Kool Kats (does he actually have a name?!), Wascally Wabbit right<br/>
behind them talking to someone I can't indentify, ArtTrekker, Black<br/>
Cavalier, Doublesaj with the cute hat, myself, and someone who I'm not<br/>
sure who I'm talking to. =)<br/>
<br/>
Picture #9: Left to right: Lisa Scenic, Lee, Charlene, Red in SF,<br/>
Wahoo, Craftee Painter, and given the black shirt, I'd have to guess<br/>
the Black Cavalier<br/>
<br/>
Picture #10: Old Blue's beer gut. =)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that's enough from me for tonight. =) Others are welcome to<br/>
contribute face/trailname links if they'd like. Especially with the<br/>
large group photos, which are a bit intimidating!<br/>
