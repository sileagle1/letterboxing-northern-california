                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi friends,<br>
<br>
I haven't heard much about dates lately so I thought I'd shortlist a <br>
couple, and call the park tomorrow and see what's available, and try to <br>
come to a decision here in the next few days.<br>
<br>
It will be one of these dates:<br>
<br>
Sat Aug 19<br>
Sun Aug 20<br>
Sat Aug 25<br>
Sun Aug 26<br>
<br>
I know some of you have said you will be available on the 19th, and <br>
others have said you won't.  For some of you, early August is better <br>
than late.  I realize that trying to pick a date that works for <br>
*everyone* is impossible.  I'm going to apologize in advance to anyone <br>
who won't be able to make it based on the date chosen.<br>
<br>
I'm leaning towards the latter weekend, but it will ultimately depend on <br>
what the park has available.  Should the park have multiple days <br>
available, I'll take a final, brief poll.  I want to have the date <br>
nailed down by Sunday, no later than Monday!<br>
<br>
I'd like to ask a few of you to join me in group-organizing this <br>
event... possibly, a group vote on the date if that's necessary, but <br>
more importantly, there will be other aspects of organization with which <br>
I'd like to have help.  First, we need a gathering name!   It would be <br>
nice to have someone coordinating the potluck, someone coordinating the <br>
letterboxing, and anyone else who wants to pitch in with ideas and <br>
suggestions and putting such things into motion.  If you're willing and <br>
able to be a part of a planning group, let me know, especially if <br>
there's an aspect of it on which you'd like to focus.<br>
<br>
I think that's all for now.  Look for a date announcement very soon!  As <br>
always, please feel free to contact me or just speak up on the list if <br>
you have some thoughts to share about the gathering plans.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
