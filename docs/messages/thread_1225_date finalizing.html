<br/>
I haven't heard much about dates lately so I thought I'd shortlist a <br/>
couple, and call the park tomorrow and see what's available, and try to <br/>
come to a decision here in the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
It will be one of these dates:<br/>
<br/>
Sat Aug 19<br/>
Sun Aug 20<br/>
Sat Aug 25<br/>
Sun Aug 26<br/>
<br/>
I know some of you have said you will be available on the 19th, and <br/>
others have said you won't.  For some of you, early August is better <br/>
than late.  I realize that trying to pick a date that works for <br/>
*everyone* is impossible.  I'm going to apologize in advance to anyone <br/>
who won't be able to make it based on the date chosen.<br/>
<br/>
I'm leaning towards the latter weekend, but it will ultimately depend on <br/>
what the park has available.  Should the park have multiple days <br/>
available, I'll take a final, brief poll.  I want to have the date <br/>
nailed down by Sunday, no later than Monday!<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to ask a few of you to join me in group-organizing this <br/>
event... possibly, a group vote on the date if that's necessary, but <br/>
more importantly, there will be other aspects of organization with which <br/>
I'd like to have help.  First, we need a gathering name!   It would be <br/>
nice to have someone coordinating the potluck, someone coordinating the <br/>
letterboxing, and anyone else who wants to pitch in with ideas and <br/>
suggestions and putting such things into motion.  If you're willing and <br/>
able to be a part of a planning group, let me know, especially if <br/>
there's an aspect of it on which you'd like to focus.<br/>
<br/>
I think that's all for now.  Look for a date announcement very soon!  As <br/>
always, please feel free to contact me or just speak up on the list if <br/>
you have some thoughts to share about the gathering plans.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
