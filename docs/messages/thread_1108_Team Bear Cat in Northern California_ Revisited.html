<br/>
Team Bear Cat is in Northern California and want to meet up with all<br/>
the non-criminal letterboxers who might have some free time on Monday<br/>
and Tuesday.  They will not have internet access while they are here,<br/>
so just contact me and I'll pass a message on to them.<br/>
<br/>
I'll take the risk of posting my mobile phone number.  <br/>
<br/>
They'll be in the Half Moon Bay area on Monday and Berkeley/Oakland on<br/>
Tuesday.  They would like to meet with folks for dinner on Tuesday<br/>
evening, and I'm looking for suggestions for restaurants that unique,<br/>
and have good lighting and enough room for anyone who might show up.<br/>

PS -- Paul, or anyone else, if you need a lift from the BART station,<br/>
just let me know.<br/>
