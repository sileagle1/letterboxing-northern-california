<br>
Thanks to our gracious hosts and planners: Old Blue, DoublesAaj, <br>
Princess Lea, Tara, and Paul on the Park.  This was my first LB event <br>
and I was not disappointed.  (Well, maybe a trifle that I only found<br>
3 boxes in 3 hours!)  We left early to meet friends for dinner in SF<br>
but I convinced my husband to take a quick driveby at dusk on our way<br>
home and I scored two more (I lost my dart...the easiest of all why <br>
did I miss it before?  and The Pink Carousel).  IT certainly is easier <br>
and faster when no one is around...maybe LBing at dusk and dawn are <br>
the best times!  I tried to make it to the CArt Box but is very dark <br>
by then and strange creatures begin to roam the park so we gave up.  <br>
<br>
I was very impressed by the artistry of carving and have vowed to get <br>
myself some colored markers and multicolored ink pads..and look<br>
foward to improving my carving skills.  <br>
<br>
Who planted Chorazin's Life?  I spent alot of time checking out the <br>
Prayerbook cross and looking for the mimosa grove areas but did not <br>
find anything.  Was there only one box located up at Stow Lake or <br>
multiple boxes at each location?  In any event, it was great fun for <br>
it indulged my love of seeing new things.  I have been to GGPark<br>
many, many times and never even knew the Prayerbook cross was there.  <br>
IT is awesome, if somewhat lonely and neglected.  Letterboxing is  a <br>
great form of psychogeography....experiencing a terrain in a new,<br>
thoughtful way.<br>
<br>
Again, it was wonderful meeting you all, if in a rather rushed<br>
manner. Sorry to see Clan Jiggs is moving back to Cananda, hopefully <br>
to spread their infectious enthusiasm of LBing!  <br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">After everyone had dispersed I went to try and find these 5 boxes.  I <br>
went 4 for 5, missing only the Prayerbook one also.  I didn't actually <br>
spend much time looking for it as there was some kind of keg party <br>
going on up there (isn't that sacrilegious?) and one of the party guys <br>
wanted to help me in my "Scavenger hunt" - he kept asking if he could <br>
see the clues!  I had to be kind of vague, and then I got out of there. <br>
  Box #2 is up by that cross, isn't it?<br>
<br>
   It is important to do your homework (online) before you start this <br>
series to find the starting point - it is not one you can intuit just <br>
from the clues.  Thanks Lizardbutt's Family!  By the way, I went <br>
through about 6:00 PM and I was the only person to sign in to the 4 I <br>
found.  If you coordinate it right, there are 3 other boxes within <br>
striking distance of this series that you can get at the same time.<br>
<br>
To answer the LB Spector's question, I believe everything except the <br>
Herbert Hoover Tree is staying in GGP.  Rich Girl which is nearby and <br>
was planted for the day will be moving to a slightly more secure <br>
location and clues will be posted on the LB.org site soon.<br>
