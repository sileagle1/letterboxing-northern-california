Are folks putting their clues on both sites all the time?<br>

Why not?  *shrug*  =)  Different people have different needs, and it<br>
makes sense that there would be letterboxing websites for all the<br>
different personalities out there.  Historically, LbNA has dominated<br>
mostly because of a lack of alternatives, but that's more a twist of<br>
fate than by design.<br>
<br>
There are actually TONS of letterboxing websites, though they're far<br>
less ambitious than LbNA and AQ.  Amanda has a letterboxing website,<br>
Silent Doug has a letterboxing website, Mark & Sue Pepe have a<br>
letterboxing website, etc.  Many have the same information, many have<br>
their own twist.  Just because it's not elaborate doesn't mean it's<br>
not a letterboxing site--and many of those personal sites have clues<br>
that are found nowhere else.<br>
<br>
So in a nutshell, why not?  =)  Coke and Pepsi, Netscape and Internet<br>
Explorer, Macs and Wintel, Paint Shop Pro and Photoshope, etc, etc,<br>
etc.  Different people have different needs and preferences, and<br>
therefore you'll get lots of choices.  =)<br>
