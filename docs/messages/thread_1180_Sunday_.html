there's an alley nearby called Cyril Magnin.  There's a Chevy's at 4th  <br/>
and Howard that might be a good alternative plus various places in the  <br/>
Metreon.  Suppenkuche is up in Hayes Valley so a little far away.  I've  <br/>
never been there but its sister restaurant Speisekammer is here in  <br/>
Alameda and we frequent it (the owners of both are Alamedans).<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used to live in that part of town (the Tenderloin, aka the 'loin),  <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; one of my favorite restaurants over there is Naan N Curry, on Eddy at<br/>
&gt; Leavenworth:<br/>
&gt; http://maps.google.com/maps? <br/>
&gt; f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=398+eddy,+san+francisco,+ca&amp;om=1<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The food is Pakistani/Indian, very tasty, and very affordable.  It's a<br/>
&gt; spacious restaurant, and the noise level isn't deafening.  You order at<br/>
&gt; the counter, sit, and wait for your food to be brought to you.   <br/>
&gt; Beverages<br/>
&gt; (other than lassis) and tableware are all self-serve, to help cut down  <br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; price.  The menu can be seen here:<br/>
&gt; http://www.naanncurry.com/<br/>
&gt; (IIRC it is right on the corner at Leavenworth, so ignore the site's<br/>
&gt; mentioning of "Levenworth &amp; Jones".)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another good restaurant in that area is Golden Era Vegetarian  <br/>
&gt; Restaurant,<br/>
&gt; a Chinese/Vietnamese/Pan-Asian restaurant (run by Vietnamese devotees  <br/>
&gt; of a<br/>
&gt; Vietnamese Buddhist lama, if I recall correctly).  It's at O'Farrell  <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; Leavenworth.  The food is fantastic, and completely vegetarian/vegan;  <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; serve lots of fake meat dishes that are so close to the real thing  <br/>
&gt; you'll<br/>
&gt; be hard pressed to tell the difference.  This is more expensive than  <br/>
&gt; NNC<br/>
&gt; but again, the food is absolutely great.  Menus here:<br/>

&gt; Map:<br/>
&gt; http://maps.google.com/maps? <br/>
&gt; f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=572+Ofarrell+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94102<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it's Friday or Monday I can join you all - Saturday and Sunday I'll  <br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; in Sac.<br/>
