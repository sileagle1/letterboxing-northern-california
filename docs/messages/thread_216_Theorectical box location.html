                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last night I was telling my husband about a great organization called <br/>
Opertion Gratitude that organizes care packages and personal letters <br/>
for soldiers overseas.  After seeing Farenheit 911 I was looking for a <br/>
positive way to help deal with my frustration over the political <br/>
situation and found this site. (Regardless of your partisan affliation <br/>
and feeling about the war, our military personnel need to thanked and <br/>
supported.  Check it out www.opgratitude.com)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, while discussing what we could include in care packages, Steve <br/>
joked I could carve a stamp and make up a letterbox and perhaps a GI <br/>
could hide it in the foxhole where Saddam Hussein was found.  Just <br/>
think of the clues!  ANyway we had a good laugh about other possible <br/>
locations for overseas boxes.  I certainly mean no disrespect to the <br/>
Iraqis, it is just that laughter is good medicine and helps motivate <br/>
more than deeling discouraged and powerless.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have fun ideas about theorectical box locations?  The <br/>
Watergate Hotel?  The Great Pyramids (Proabbly on ethere already for <br/>
all I know)  The Eiffel Tower?  <br/>

<br/>
I heard they sealed that foxhole so as not to make it a rallying <br/>
point for supporters of Saddam Hussein.  So that's not going to <br/>
work!  =)<br/>

<br/>
For those of you that are familiar with Atlas Quest, I've put in a <br/>
couple of 'fake cities' for purely my own amusement.  Not that I ever <br/>
expected anyone to discover them on their own, but there are two <br/>
towns I've included that you won't find on any map.  =)<br/>
<br/>
The first is "Weapons of Mass Destruction", which is located in Iraq, <br/>
of course.  (I've had a morbid sense of fun telling people <br/>
that, "Yeah, I know where the weapons of mass destruction are in <br/>
Iraq!")<br/>
<br/>
You'll also find a small town in western Connecticut called <br/>
Stepford.  =)  I'm itching to actually hide a Stepford box and list <br/>
the location as being in 'Stepford, CT', but I don't get out to that <br/>
part of the country very often, so for now it'll have to stay on my <br/>
to-do list.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I was also playing with ideas for adding towns like "Hell, Michigan", <br/>
but as it turns out, there really is a town named Hell in Michigan!  <br/>
The joke was on me, I guess.  =)  (Am I the only person that thinks <br/>
Hell, Michigan, is just BEGGING for a letterbox?!)<br/>
<br/>
I might add a few more joke cities as I think of them, though.  Just <br/>
to keep things interesting....<br/>
