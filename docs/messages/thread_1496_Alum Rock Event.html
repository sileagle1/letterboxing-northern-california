First the egg red herring and now the misinformation campaign (this is<br>
what I expected when I planned this for April Fool's Day--I just though<br>
I'd be pulling the jokes and not falling for someone else's).<br>
<br>
The gathering is absolutely positively on SUNDAY April 1st. I am<br>
sleeping in on Saturday, so anyone who shows up on Saturday is out of<br>
luck. Besides, I think some lucky 10 year old is having his birthday<br>
party at that picnic area on Saturday. So while you might score some<br>
cake and maybe a piece of candy from the pinata, I suspect if you ask<br>
them if they are letterboxers they won't respond with, "which direction<br>
is north?", but instead suggest that you go pound sand. Or perhaps<br>
wack you with the pinata stick thinking you are one of those guys Chris<br>
Hansen catches being bad Dobby.<br>
<br>
No Foolin' IT'S ON SUNDAY!! The AQ Announcement is true. I am<br>
pulling lots of other tricks, but I wouldn't mess with the date or<br>
meeting time. Besides, there's a whole mess of food showing up at<br>
11:30am on SUNDAY. While the squirrels would be just tickled pink by<br>
their sudden bounty, the Ranger would not appreciate the sudden<br>
epidemic of obesity of the resident bushy tailed vermin. <br>
<br>
So, the fake dog poo letterboxes will be planted that morning. Be sure<br>
to bring your pooper scooper and gloves in case you mistake the real<br>
thing for a letterbox. I'm going to the neighbor's yard that morning<br>
to collect some "live rounds" to plant amongst the fakes ones. Keep it<br>
interesting. (Maybe we should have let DemXXMen run with the egg<br>
idea....)<br>
<br>
Remember, this isn't espionage, it's letterboxing! Let's go have some<br>
fun. Enjoy that spring has FINALLY sprung, that Uncle Sam will soon<br>
extract his pound of flesh and then it will be another year before we<br>
have to endure taxes again (no offense Da Kool Kats--you undoubtedly<br>
make a painful process less so, but it's still tax season!). And yes,<br>
the park will be chock full o' non-letterboxers. Hey, it will make<br>
things a challenge. Think of them like crazy rabid squirrels. Could<br>
be annoying, could be your best form of entertainment. It's all a<br>
matter of perspective.<br>
<br>
So, joke away DemXXMen, just make sure you don't forget to show up on<br>
the actual day! :)<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Renee, who has recently found her sense of humor that had been<br>
misplaced. The three glasses of Wattle Creek Muscat might have<br>
something to do with that...... <br>

At least I am....I went to my first letterboxing event three weeks<br>
after I stumbled onto letterboxing.  I had NO IDEA what to expect, and<br>
was to impressed with how kind, fun and generous Northern California<br>
letterboxers are.<br>
