http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=5689<br/>
<br/>
Dem XX Men alerted me to the fact that some brand-new boxers (who were<br/>
very enthusiastic, and wrote happy notes in the logbook) got a bit<br/>
confused at my letterbox, and took the stamp they had carved, leaving<br/>
behind a hand carved stamp and a sparkly little bracelet.<br/>
<br/>
If you are the finder of this letterbox, can you contact me?  I would<br/>
like to replace the stamp that I carved for this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

switching!  Do you think someone explained letterboxing to this new<br/>
person as "geocaching, but with rubber stamps" and this is how it was<br/>
interpreted?  I certainly hope this is misunderstanding gets cleared<br/>
up ASAP and the stamps returned to their rightful places.<br/>
<br/>
On a perkier note, Black Cavalier, 3CatFam and I have a fun filled day<br/>
planned for tomorrow (Tuesday).  We'll be doing a tour of Sonoma<br/>
County, primarily in Petaluma, if anyone cares to join us for part or<br/>
all of our adventure.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I struck out on a sweep through the Peninsula - I was on my<br/>
way to a SuperBowl party.  I only got 1 out of the 4 I attempted -<br/>
Crossroads in Hillsborough.  The other 3 appear to be missing, and<br/>
they are:<br/>
<br/>
Beresford Park<br/>
San Mateo Public Library<br/>
In the Hollow<br/>
<br/>
Just so you know in case you were planning a trip down there any time soon<br/>
