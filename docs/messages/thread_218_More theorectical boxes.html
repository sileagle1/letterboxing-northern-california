<br>
How about a box in Monkey's Eyebrow, TX?  Looneyville, TX or Jot'Em <br>
Down, TX?  What is it about Tesas and place names (They also gave us <br>
EGypt, Paris, Happy and Earth. I think I may have to make a <br>
java-fueled pilgramage to Hot Coffee, Missouri to plant a box there.  <br>
And while there head on over to Toad Suck, Arkansas. <br>
<br>
Then up to Des Plaines, IL to leave a box for Herve Villechaize <br>
(Tattoo from Fantasy Island).  <br>
<br>
OR perhpas a box to commemorate the Okra Strut in Irmo, SC?  Or the <br>
Whole Enchilada Fiesta in Las Cruces, NM?  But my personal favorite<br>
is <br>
the Boggy Bayou Mullet Festival held in Niceville, FL.  (IT's nice to <br>
be nice to the nice....my family's inside joke)  They hold an annual <br>
interstate mullet toss between FL and Alabama.  <br>
<br>
While browsing your site I did see the TOm McCall preserve box.  IT <br>
brought back memories of when I lived in Portland, I loved that<br>
place. <br>
I always stopped there when I drove out to see STeve in Eastern WA.  <br>
And also acrooss the gorge Merryhill.  What in the Sam Hill?  Another <br>
great box location if none there.  Perhaps the stamp could be the <br>
Queen of Romania's crown. <br>

<br>
Yeah, definitely a great location for a box!  I know there's one at <br>
the Maryhill museum and (used to be?) a box a Stonehenge.  There's <br>
plenty of room for many more, however!<br>
