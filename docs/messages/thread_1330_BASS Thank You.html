                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
This has been the first time I've had enough time - and energy - to sit <br/>
down and write about the gathering.  I had a great time, but as some of <br/>
you know, I was running short on sleep the morning of BASS, so when I <br/>
got home last night I was just totally wiped!<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank you all for coming out to the BASS yesterday.  I was so <br/>
hopeful when I threw my idea out there a few months back that the <br/>
response would be enthusiastic and friendly, and it was so, so much more <br/>
than that.  You all really threw yourselves into it and I had an <br/>
absolutely fantastic time.  In particular, I want to thank:<br/>
<br/>
- Princess Lea, for getting there very early, setting up, and rescuing <br/>
our spot from the potential clutches of our neighbors, and for all her <br/>
advice.  Your letter stamps were really gorgeous, too; wish I'd got them <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
- Team Tysonosaurus, for assistance and enthusiasm to pick up where I <br/>
could not carry.  The potluck turned out fulsome and delicious under <br/>
your direction.  Your boxes were fun finds too!<br/>
<br/>
- Grumpy Grinch, for tirelessly manning the grill and keeping us all <br/>
well-fed, and doing it with much humor and skill.<br/>
<br/>
- artTrekker, for the unbelievably awesome event stamp!  Your skills <br/>
leave me speechless.<br/>
<br/>
- dem xx men, whose endless enthusiasm really put a shine on this <br/>
event.  The zine just blew me away, and it was so useful to boot!  All <br/>
of your many creative boxes were just above and beyond the call of <br/>
letterboxing duty.  The box in the birthday cake was just perfect.  You <br/>
made me smile and I'm glad we met!<br/>
<br/>
- Sierra Sally, for her great company and comfy transportation as we <br/>
boxed together.  It was great getting to know you, and thank you for <br/>
coming so far to hang out with us!<br/>
<br/>
- mimulus, for bringing the Circus to town!  Those stamps have already <br/>
gotten a ton of wows from friends looking at my book.  It was a great <br/>
idea and a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
- Zairabear, for her amazing poker face.  My ridiculous attempts to pump <br/>
you for information were met with the stoicism they deserved.  :) Your <br/>
Beamie PT is a stumper and I'm still scratching my head!<br/>
<br/>
- Carole of Da Kool Kats, for much behind the scenes support, advice, <br/>
and enthusiasm.  Also for the fantastic name tags!<br/>
<br/>
- Lisascenic, for suggesting this awesome spot!  I loved the views of <br/>
the city, and the big container ships.<br/>
<br/>
- RedSF, for helping me clean up towards the end of the day.  I'm also <br/>
really sorry about the scratch on your car. :(<br/>
<br/>
- OBJuan, for the most puzzling and personally rewarding box of the day, <br/>
for me.  I wish you could've joined us, but I'm glad you planted anyway. :)<br/>
<br/>
- Aahz, for the PT stamp that made me laugh out loud.<br/>
<br/>
If I didn't thank you personally, please know that I thought of you - I <br/>
can picture nearly everyone I met yesterday - and I'm really glad you <br/>
came.  Thank you for your enthusiasm, and for joining us and making this <br/>
event really great!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about you guys, but I'm pink from the sun, tired, and I <br/>
have about 40 or more stamps to log on AQ.  And I can't wait to do this <br/>
again!<br/>

all the thanks to everyone who was there.  <br/>
<br/>
Audrey and I realized we were there for 11 hours and I still feel like I ran out of time to <br/>
talk to everyone!  I especially had fun being manic with artTrekker - I promise some day I'll <br/>
get up to Tahoe for a letterboxing tour.  I wasn't wearing my usual sunglasses all day (left <br/>
them at the picnic table), so now I am sporting an interesting sunburn on the strip of pale <br/>
skin just under my eyes that are usually protected by the glasses.  It's super attractive, as <br/>
you can well imagine.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry the Boggle game wasn't better exectuted.  I should have done something like <br/>
what Javalord suggested like put them all on benches so that there was some rhyme or <br/>
reason to the game.  Maybe the game will show up at anotehr event some day, only better <br/>
organized......<br/>
