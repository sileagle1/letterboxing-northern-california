<br>
And hello back at you guys! (Remember, I'm a major Sagittarian, too!)<br>
<br>
If you've liked my stamps, the 2 most recent ones, "Ortus Depths" <br>
and "Magritte: The Therapeutist" both have folding stamps that are <br>
great images.<br>
<br>
It's the new scooter that's got me re-energized. It's SO MUCH easier <br>
to plant & monitor boxes now... I never would've found the odd <br>
location for The Therapeutist if I wasn't zipping around the city <br>
exploring. <br>
<br>
Nice to hear from you!<br>
Paul in SF<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I was so excited to see Paul's newly planted<br>
boxes, that after work, I went right away and found<br>
Ortus Depths. What a great location.  No one was there<br>
when I went, but people who go on a sunny day will<br>
want to practice stealth.<br>
<br>
I didn't have time to look for the other box, but I<br>
might suggest that people look at a map when preparing<br>
to look for the box because I know one can get to twin<br>
peaks via Clarendon from both directions (roughly east<br>
or west). There is a center divider most of the way,<br>
but one can turn left onto Johnstone. Johnstone begins<br>
at Clarendon.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Paul.<br>
