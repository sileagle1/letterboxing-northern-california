<br/>
And hello back at you guys! (Remember, I'm a major Sagittarian, too!)<br/>
<br/>
If you've liked my stamps, the 2 most recent ones, "Ortus Depths" <br/>
and "Magritte: The Therapeutist" both have folding stamps that are <br/>
great images.<br/>
<br/>
It's the new scooter that's got me re-energized. It's SO MUCH easier <br/>
to plant &amp; monitor boxes now... I never would've found the odd <br/>
location for The Therapeutist if I wasn't zipping around the city <br/>
exploring. <br/>
<br/>
Nice to hear from you!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I was so excited to see Paul's newly planted<br/>
boxes, that after work, I went right away and found<br/>
Ortus Depths. What a great location.  No one was there<br/>
when I went, but people who go on a sunny day will<br/>
want to practice stealth.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have time to look for the other box, but I<br/>
might suggest that people look at a map when preparing<br/>
to look for the box because I know one can get to twin<br/>
peaks via Clarendon from both directions (roughly east<br/>
or west). There is a center divider most of the way,<br/>
but one can turn left onto Johnstone. Johnstone begins<br/>
at Clarendon.<br/>

Thanks, Paul.<br/>
