It seems like Funhog always places them just a bit further then you <br/>
think. She has a little devilish streak. Hey are you guys heading <br/>

You can say that again!!  Looking for another of Funhog's boxes, we <br/>
hiked across a lava field near the coast, and hiked, and hiked, and <br/>
hiked.  We were not adequately prepared for that length and ended up <br/>
turning back.  It gives us another good reason to return to Maui.<br/>

We hope to, but won't know for another day or two.  We need to <br/>

Boy, ain't that the truth. If we just remember that Funhog REALLY<br/>
likes to hike, we might never turn back too soon. So thanks for<br/>
reminding me, and thanks for the recommendations. btw, was that the<br/>
lava field south of Makena? (which box?)<br/>
<br/>
Lisa, sorry you got sick! I hope it was just the sniffles and not that<br/>
icky stomach flu thing that's been going around. Hope you're feeling<br/>
better now. I have received your hint...is the event to which you<br/>
refer Desperately Seeking Sun? I'd better get on it.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to hear from you, Mim!! I see that there are at least four boxes<br/>
at Hog (Hell) that appeared after I went there. So I guess I will have<br/>
to go back sometime (oooo, how I dread it!). Maybe we can plan to<br/>
meet...I won't be able to go till April, though. And San Jose will<br/>
start off the month.<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is staying warm by carving...aT<br/>

It was Funhog's King's Highway box near Kihei.  You can pick up <br/>
another box or two on the way.<br/>

island, I too stumbled over that hot lava field. The King's Highway<br/>
box is in it's little hidey hole safe and sound awaiting visitors. The<br/>
black sand beach nearby is as lovely (and deserted) as ever. I spent a<br/>
good portion of the afternoon there without seeing another soul and<br/>
this on Maui in high season!<br/>
<br/>
The Maui Sunset box is in place and has been visited many times. The<br/>
two boxes in the high forest were another story. I intended to check<br/>
those in the morning and hit the lava fields in the afternoon. Sadly,<br/>
recent forest fires have resulted in the closing of all trails in the<br/>
Poli Poli Reserve. Not only that, but the road is gated. The area will<br/>
reopen in May after extensive cleanup but there's a good chance that<br/>
the letterboxes there are toast, literally. I won't be back until next<br/>
year but be forewarned. Manu Make may be truly Make. Funhog<br/>

Just had a little visit with the Maui Sunset box this afternoon. Hot!<br/>

Maui? I left a little something behind in Hana, but haven't posted<br/>
clues yet, so if you're going, let me know. Or if you want any latest<br/>
info on something in particular. Hope you're having a great time, &amp;<br/>
sorry I missed you! aT<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; aT ,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When are you coming home? I'll be in Hawaii Sat 3/10 - 3/18.<br/>

<br/>
I bet you're having a blast, seeing lots of whales &amp; sun. The Hana<br/>
box is the only one I planted on Maui. I would recommend any of the<br/>
ones by Blackvelvetrav, LadyB or Funhog (Maui Sunset, esp. ,as the<br/>
others may be biggish hikes). Have fun, don;t forget your sunscreen,<br/>
and go see Warren in Lahaina if you want to laugh till your sides split.<br/>

&gt; Hi aT,<br/>
&gt;   Well I'm on a cruise, and we hae going to the Big Island tomorrow.<br/>
I'll be in Maui, Friday and Sat. I don't think I'll be in Hana though.<br/>
Just left Kauai today. Didn't get your box in Poipu today because I<br/>
didn't know the Hawaiian words. Darn it!! Will look for some of your<br/>
boxes in Maui. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Hey Lisa, found a couple of your boxes too at Tunnels Beach, and<br/>
Poipu Beach. <br/>
&gt;   Having a great time<br/>

  Yep it took some figurin but we found it.. it's beautiful carving too. We were disappointed we didn't get to see your original stamp for Poipu but as you probably know someone put a store bought stamp in there for you. Got to see the monk seal though. We found Nene too. It's in good shape too.<br/>
  Kona today, no time for boxing. but Maui tomorrow... <br/>
