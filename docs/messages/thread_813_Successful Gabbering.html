enough.....<br>
Thank you everyone for making the event such a success.  The food was <br>
wonderful...and doesn't everyone eat to much at the fair?  Moonrabbit <br>
your box was a little jewel and Laura the event stamp positively <br>
rocks.  <br>
<br>
Great personal travelers and I have two hitchhikers to find homes <br>
for..so gotta go boxing and move them along.  <br>
<br>
I forgot to print out disgruntled couple's story...it seems after <br>
standing in line at the stinky porta potties, and ma not winning a <br>
blue ribbon for her jams, and pa not winning a ribbon with his prized <br>
heifer they were bummed.  To add insult to injury, when they went to <br>
the carnival they got snookered into spending $20 on ring toss and all <br>
they got was a silly gnome. <br>
<br>
Happy trails, <br>
