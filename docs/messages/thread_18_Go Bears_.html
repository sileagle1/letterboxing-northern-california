                    <div class="plaintext-content">As I watched the Big Game this year I was reminded that I carved my first stamps <br/>
during last year's Big Game - so it's officially been a year since I started.  Doublesaj <br/>
and Old Blue - did you go?  This is a California group, so I'm not too far off topic, <br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I spent a little time this morning putting the finishing touches on my Survivor: <br/>
Pearl Islands series which has been underway all season long.  I found it somewhat <br/>
difficult to write the clues in "Pirate," so it took me a long time to develop the clues.  <br/>
Plus, I am in a depression because my favorite player (Rupert) got voted off this week.  <br/>
So, there's a new Northern California set of boxes to be found.  It is located in one of <br/>
those places with the touchy rangers, so that's why I made it them mystery boxes.  If <br/>
you are having trouble interpreting the clues (especially for the starting point), please <br/>
contact me directly.  If I "recognize" you as a legitimate letterboxer, and not soeone <br/>
out to destroy my hard work, I'll help to get you pointed in the right direction.  <br/>

I'm sad about that too, but I can't say I was really too surprised.  <br/>
Those that stand out make the best targets, and sheeze, what a target <br/>
he would make.  I hate that Jon guy, though.  So smug and--<br/>
irritating!  I'd have voted him off on day 1!<br/>

A moment of silence for Rupert....<br/>

We watched the game at my folks' house - both Cal alumni. My daughter was wearing <br/>
her Cal cheerleader outfit. Funny, we didn't start winning until she woke up from her <br/>
nap.<br/>
<br/>
Lea, I'm looking forward to trying your mystery boxes. I think I have a good idea about <br/>
where to look for some Mai Tais.<br/>
<br/>
I found out I've got too many vacation hours racked up at work so looks like I may be <br/>
forced to take some letterboxing days. (aw shucks!)<br/>
