Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Redsf, SFmomo and Scott had our most successful LBing weekend.<br>
Ususally we are not so <br>
organized, but this weekend we found 13 boxes total and one HH (that<br>
is good for us!).  <br>
Saturday we headed down towards Half Moon Bay. We stopped at "Where's<br>
Waldo" but we <br>
could not find him. Will have to email Tara and ask her about that<br>
one. We then found <br>
"Pagurus" in Moss Beach. We were the first LBing finders, however he<br>
had been found by <br>
others. One message inside the logbook read, "This is cool. What is<br>
this?". He also wasn't <br>
hidden at all, so we did our best to hide him. Next we did the Flying<br>
Pigs two boxes along <br>
the Purisima Creek trail. We were first finders there too. That was a<br>
very nice hike. Then we <br>
hit Anna & the Kid's Coastside Trail and found both of those boxes.<br>
They had been found <br>
earlier Sat. Sunday we went to Kennedy Grove Regional Park. We found<br>
all 5 boxes in the <br>
Boxer Family series. All were okay except Lucy Boxer had gotten<br>
waterlogged and most <br>
stamp images were washed away =/.  We wrapped the book in some tissue<br>
and hopefully <br>
it will dry out more. We then found Tara's two Pirate boxes and ended<br>
our day with the <br>
"Itchy" box and picked up the Stanislaus HH. I forget whom to credit<br>
with that HH. I'm <br>
sorry. Will email the creator later today.<br>
