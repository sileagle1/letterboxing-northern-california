<br/>
We  took a short trip out to Davis today, to try and pick up a box <br/>
or two, and update the Best of Davis series. Here's what we found...<br/>
<br/>
A Rocky Trail - Missing (?) we spent about 90 minutes looking for <br/>
what was described as a 10 minute "kid-friendly" box...with nothing <br/>
to show for it. According to the clues, the box was near a white emu <br/>
egg shaped rock and a loaf of french bread!! Problem is the whole <br/>
dry stream bed is full of rocks that could fit the bill! The kids <br/>
got bored after about 15 minutes of searching, so they enjoyed the <br/>
nearby playground! I finally gave in and we moved on to...<br/>
<br/>
Best of Davis 1-4<br/>
<br/>
We had done this series last summer, using a store-bought stamp, so <br/>
figured we'd retrace and restamp as we went. This would also give us <br/>
an opportunity to pick up the replanted #3 as a "find".<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 - alive and well. Book is absolutely full. We didn't have a <br/>
bok that small, otherwise I would have replaced it.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 - alive and well, with a replaced book already there.<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 - box and book are there, but some little "sweetheart" has <br/>
stolen the stamp. According to the clues, the stamp was replaced <br/>
only a week or two ago. The previous visitors on 8 May stated the <br/>
stamp was missing at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Box #4 - alive and well. Book is getting pretty full.<br/>

Don't we know it! We found this box just after it was listed and actually <br/>
wrote a letter to the placer warning that they planted it exactly in the drainage <br/>
ditch of where all the water would drain when it rained (Don't people look <br/>
out for these things when they plant!?) We looked forever too and finally found <br/>
the "rock that looked like French bread" (EXACTLY like a loaf of French <br/>
bread!) So it might still be there but we're betting it was full of water.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Best of Davis Series, thanks for the heads-up. Might have a chance <br/>
on Sunday to do something about the full books and missing stamp but not a <br/>
moment before. <br/>
<br/>
On another note; did you try for Best of Davis #5?<br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
but good impressions. Sir B<br/>

I found the Rocky Trail but it was hard. I was there just before Mothers Day. <br/>
I found that loaf rock too, but there's another one. <br/>
<br/>
I found Best of Davis #1 but never found the rest of that series. So you're <br/>
up on me there.<br/>

Thanks to your heads up notice, we've recarved our Best of Davis #3 stamp and <br/>
replaced it in the letterbox. We have stamped its image on paper and would be <br/>
happy to send you a copy of it by email (since you earned it!) if you'd like. <br/>
Let us know.<br/>
