<br/>
My Golden Gate box went MIA so I recarved (I think it's worse than my<br/>
first...can that be possible? I'm blaming it on the fact that I think the<br/>
eraser was old. Bet you're all jumpin at the bit to get that one after my<br/>
lovely decription). I put the replacement in a new spot. I also added a<br/>
second box to the site (this one is a little better). It's really the view<br/>
you should go for.<br/>
<br/>
Spongebob inTennessee Valley: My one piece of art (the third stamp of the<br/>
series)...it actually didn't suck. I woke up one morning and was inspired<br/>
(that is sooooooo rare I can't even tell you). I found out today it was<br/>
vandalized. Someone gauged out parts of it. I saw the image that was left<br/>
because it was my friend and her family that went looking for it. it's<br/>
really too bad. Anyway, it might look better if the gauges were turned into<br/>
something because some of the image is still there. So.......does anyone<br/>
want to do some carving/repairing while relaxing on a beautiful black sand<br/>
beach????? If yes, be my guest and let me know how it goes. You may want to<br/>
peek at Spongebob characters before you go though. <br/>
