<br>
My husband & I are planning to take a week of vacation in November <br>
and one of the destinations under consideration is Northern <br>
California.  We'd like to make it a hiking/LBing vacation and I was <br>
hoping some of you could provide some info/advice.<br>
<br>
1.  From the weather history I can find on the Internet, it seems <br>
temperatures would be in the mid 60s to low 70s.  Is there much rain <br>
in early to mid November?<br>
<br>
2.  We enjoy hiking, so would enjoy finding boxes in interesting <br>
parks on hikes of 3-15 miles.  I haven't done a thorough study of the <br>
clues yet, but from a brief survey it looks like there might be some <br>
nice hikes in the San Luis Obispo area.  Can you recommend any <br>
particular locations in the San Francisco / Central Coast area?<br>
<br>
I'd really appreciate any info you can provide re: good hiking and <br>
boxing areas.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
