                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will be bringing a Valentine-themed traveler with me to the workshop  on Saturday. What the logbook wants from those who desire the stamp is  a roughly 2x2 piece of paper with something artful on it--verbal or  not--relating to love, that can be affixed in the book. The artful and  the love are the key words here. It can be collage or finger paint or  doctored photograph or whatever, but the logbook wants to be more than  just a record of sig stamps...it told me it wants to be a scrapbook,  and it doesn't really care if you think you are artistic, it knows you  are creative and will please it.<br/>
<br/>
    Looking forward to Saturday,<br/>
