I've only ever seen one in the wild, and that was in Texas, while I<br/>
was writing postcards at the picnic table of our camping area.  Robb<br/>
missed the whole thing -- he was in the shower.  And my camera was on<br/>
the other side of the camp from the bobcat, durn it all!<br/>

Thanks for sharing your blog with us!<br/>

I was looking at a website on wildflowers in Calfornia, and I had a a<br/>
silly Mimulus question.  Do Sticky Monkeys live in Sticky Chinese Houses?<br/>

We seem to have a VERY BIG one living near the top of the hill above <br/>
our house. He has cruised by like he owns the place several times. So <br/>
far he is running when my youngest Brittany comes out of the house <br/>
barking at him. I just hope that behavior continues. When I first saw <br/>
him this winter he had an extemely full darkish coat and I thought he <br/>
was a small bear. The one thing that seems to be a real benefit is <br/>
that we have fewer coyotes near the house. Those guys are a real <br/>
problem as they like to go after dogs and cats (regular cats). Last <br/>
summer one of our neighbors spooked a cougar that was sleeping in the <br/>
shade under his deck. That I can live without.<br/>
