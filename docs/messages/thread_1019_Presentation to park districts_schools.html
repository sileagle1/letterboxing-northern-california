  I've heard of boxers making presentations to their park districts on<br/>
letterboxing as a hobby, in hopes of convincing them to allow boxes to<br/>
be planted in the parks.  For those that have done that, how were the<br/>
presentations received?  What worked &amp; what didn't?  Anyone have<br/>
suggestions on what type of information to include in a presentation<br/>
like that?  I may be making one soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Black Cavalier<br/>
