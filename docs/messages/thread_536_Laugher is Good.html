aT, <br/>
<br/>
Your description truly made me laugh, and laughter is a good way to<br/>
start the day!!  I thought it was just our age and couch potato life<br/>
style that was causing our discomfort, but if you felt it also, maybe<br/>
it really is a tough trek.  <br/>
<br/>
Every time I think of that hill after box #4 and then realize that it<br/>
was never ending and the worse was yet to come, my heart starts<br/>
pounding and I feel lightheaded. And, on top of all that, to have to<br/>
walk out in the dark was like adding "insult to injury" or more<br/>
discomfort to our already exhaustion or even adding salt to an open wound.<br/>
<br/>
And, to think we have to do it again so we can count #5.  By that<br/>
time, we should know "dem hills" quite well.  <br/>
<br/>
But, I must say, we do feel as if we've accomplished a great feat.<br/>

&gt; There are parts that are STEEP!!!! Feels like straight<br/>
&gt; up. Then up some more. Then, oh, up some more! The<br/>
&gt; advice given to me re: getting Sideways and Planet<br/>
&gt; Walk in one trek was to do PW till just past Saturn,<br/>
&gt; then detour onto Gray Pine Trail to do Sideways, then<br/>
&gt; take Brushy Peaks Trail (pay attention to this name,<br/>
&gt; especially the second word) back to PW and do Pluto,<br/>
&gt; Neptune and Uranus in that order. That is all fine and<br/>
&gt; good. Start out first thing in the morning and give<br/>
&gt; yourself all day so you don't have to try to hurry any<br/>
&gt; part of it like some of us did. I am a backpacker from<br/>
&gt; way back and sneer a little when I see people using<br/>
&gt; the double walking stick technique of hiking. I'll<br/>
&gt; tell ya, I wish we'd each had a pair for this hike.<br/>
&gt; Especially for the downhills.<br/>
