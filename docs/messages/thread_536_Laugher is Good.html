aT, <br>
<br>
Your description truly made me laugh, and laughter is a good way to<br>
start the day!!  I thought it was just our age and couch potato life<br>
style that was causing our discomfort, but if you felt it also, maybe<br>
it really is a tough trek.  <br>
<br>
Every time I think of that hill after box #4 and then realize that it<br>
was never ending and the worse was yet to come, my heart starts<br>
pounding and I feel lightheaded. And, on top of all that, to have to<br>
walk out in the dark was like adding "insult to injury" or more<br>
discomfort to our already exhaustion or even adding salt to an open wound.<br>
<br>
And, to think we have to do it again so we can count #5.  By that<br>
time, we should know "dem hills" quite well.  <br>
<br>
But, I must say, we do feel as if we've accomplished a great feat.<br>
