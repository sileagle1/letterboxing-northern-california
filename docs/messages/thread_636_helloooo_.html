<br/>
Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen me around?<br/>
I was just wondering if anyone here has been to any of my boxes or seen my hitchhiker floating on its way. (Not that it's in the water)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone's wondering if I have anything to do with Bonedoc or The Messenger, I do. they're not my parents however. These ppl. are my Godparents. Bonedoc is my godmother and The Messenger is my godfather. Great ppl.<br/>
<br/>
If you guys have seen my hitch hiker (its called B-day Bear/B-B) you have probaly noticed that it doesn't have any contact info. on it. This is because on all of our b-days we set out a hitchhiker. All of these were our first ones so we didn't really know what to do w/ them.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen B-day Bones or Angel???? (hitch hikers)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm 13 and I love letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to get to know you all!<br/>
<br/>
~Lil' Bear<br/>

 I found your Birthday Bear near Sacramento.  You can see the progress<br/>
of it at this web page that tracks a hitchhiker's travels:<br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/travelers.html.  I dropped it off again &amp; I<br/>
think I heard someone picked it up.  I contacted Bonedoc when I found it<br/>
&amp; she gave me an email to add to the hitchhiker for people to use for<br/>
contact.  So your Birthday Bear does have contact information on it now.<br/>
  You planted the Aristacat micro-box at the winery, right?  I found<br/>
that just last week.  I really liked the cat stamp, it was very cute.<br/>
Unforunately, the log book had gotten wet so most of the stamp ink had<br/>
run.  I suggested to this group that if anyone lived close to it, they<br/>
might be able to take it home &amp; dry it out for a few days.  Thanks for<br/>
planting the box there.  It was a very pretty place and nice to find a<br/>
letterbox while my wife tried the wine.<br/>
