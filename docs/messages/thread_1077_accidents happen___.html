letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Robb fell from a ladder while working for the theater<br/>
dept at UC Berkeley.  Long story, but he was trying to keep a light<br/>
from bashing another worker in the head, and ended up getting dragged<br/>
off the ladder and falling onto a concrete floor.<br/>
<br/>
He fell on his back and a vertebra was crushed, and the bone went into<br/>
the spinal collumn.  He had surgery yesterday, and we won't know for<br/>
some time just how serious this injury will be.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us in your thoughts, and if you think of it, send him a get well<br/>
card.<br/>
<br/>
Robb Bauer<br/>
590 Merritt Avenue #24<br/>
Oakland CA 94610<br/>
<br/>
He's sure to need some cheering up.<br/>

ps -- I may have some questions for you medical letterboxers out<br/>
there.  I think I need some help decyphering all the new information<br/>
that I'm taking in.<br/>
