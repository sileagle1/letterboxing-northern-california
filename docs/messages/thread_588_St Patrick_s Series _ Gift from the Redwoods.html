A great weekend locating all of the St. Patrick's Series.  Wonderful<br>
views and great stamps!  At The Bredan, a large redwood tree has<br>
fallen across the path "at the rise."  Climbing over was a bit "harey"<br>
for this rabbit--thank goodness I had an extra pair of jeans! How my<br>
hubby, Silliyak, got over the tree without a trace of mud, I'll never<br>
know!  A great series, well worth the adventure to Mendocino.<br>
<br>
Speaking of, Gift from the Redwoods was quite the challenge since the<br>
park is closed for the winter and all camp signs covered.  But we took<br>
a good guess but had to drive back and forth waiting for the radar cop<br>
to leave the entrance--chasing a speeding PT Cruiser.  We just sneaked<br>
right in and found the little gift.<br>
