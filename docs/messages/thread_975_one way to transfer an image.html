                    <div class="plaintext-content">Assuming the image is not one of my original drawings, alter the contrast in Photoshop, and print out the picture that I'm working from in black and white.  Then I use a pencil and draw all the "important" lines on the front of the image.  Then I flip the paper over, tape it to my carving material and rub the back with a pencil.  Finally, I take a fine point ball point pen, and re-draw the image on the carving material.<br/>
<br/>
No solvents.  Minimal mess.  I work with art materials all day, and don't want solvents in my home if I can possibly avoid it!<br/>
<br/>
I make "proofs" of my image with a gold ink pad, and wash that ink away as I'm carving.  The ballpoint ink stains the pink stuff, so I can wash the ink right off.  Finally, when I think the stamp looks the way it should, I make prints with a black stamp pad.  THat gives me the most visual "punch," and most of my images are meant to be printed with black ink.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that makes some sense.<br/>
