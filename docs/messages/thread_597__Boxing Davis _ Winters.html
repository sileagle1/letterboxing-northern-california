We were first finders of Ty's "Grinding Stone" box near Winters <br/>
today. What a beautiful day for a hike! Coincidentally, the local <br/>
newspaper had a story about beautiful trails to visit and THIS was <br/>
one of them so there were MANY people on this well-manicured, native <br/>
plant-infested trail. (Mimulus, you'd love it!) <br/>
<br/>
We were so inspired, we planted 2 boxes ourselves: one about 3 miles <br/>
from this one and one about 12 miles west, near Davis. So take a trip <br/>
up and enjoy them all!<br/>
