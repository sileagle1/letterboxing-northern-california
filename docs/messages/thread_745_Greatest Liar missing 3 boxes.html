                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's an update on the Greatest Liar series.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes 1, 2 and 3 are still there. If anyone went there and didn't <br/>
find them, I'm not sure how to explain that - they're definitely <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, a letterboxing family did their daughter's 10th <br/>
birthday on a letterboxing theme and replaced boxes 4, 5 and 6 <br/>
with temporary boxes. If anyone wants to find all 6 boxes, they <br/>
are there as of 2 days ago!<br/>
<br/>
Box 5 is in a slightly different location than the original, but if you <br/>
look all along the logs you'll find it under some pieces of bark, on <br/>
the side of the logs away from the path.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who came by already!<br/>
<br/>
By way of a more personal update, our son is less intensely into <br/>
letterboxing, and I've been dealing with a health problem for <br/>
going on 3 months, which explains why you have not heard from <br/>
us all this time. We've boxed a little though, and hope to do more <br/>
some time soon.<br/>
