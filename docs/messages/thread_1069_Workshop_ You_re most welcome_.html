yesterday. I'm happy to schedule another session for those who <br>
missed it, if there are 5 or more people who will attend -- let me <br>
know.<br>
<br>
Wow! Great workshop! You literally generated hundreds of ideas, and <br>
from those, there's potential for more variations and combinations. <br>
Remember, even those ideas that seemed too strange or bad might have <br>
their day sometime -- or they just need adjusting!<br>
<br>
I also hope you'll try these techniques out with solving various <br>
problems or generating ideas for other things you do. Example: try <br>
coming up with ideas for a party now!<br>
<br>
It was great meeting and seeing everyone -- for me, the time went by <br>
very fast. Thank you for your interest and participation. You were <br>
great!<br>
<br>
IDEA from NILS: Nils suggests that people type up their notes and e-<br>
mail them to him. He'll then collate them, and send out a group e-<br>
mail with everyone's notes. And, if you anyone want something from <br>
the content on the flipcharts, let me know, OK?<br>
<br>
SO, WHO'S PLAYING MINIATURE GOLF TODAY? Huh? <br>
