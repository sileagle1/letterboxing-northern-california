Hi,<br/>
  I asked this in the Newboxers group a few weeks ago, but didn't get <br/>
much of an answer.  Has anyone read Ryan Carpenter's Letterboxing <br/>
book?  I'm curious if it has any information beyond what is available <br/>
on the main LB sites (lb.org, aq.com, lb.info).  I'm thinking about <br/>
getting it, but am worried it may be redundant since I've read all <br/>
the tutorials &amp; FAQs.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
*hehe*  You both got the wrong Ryan.  I think the book you're talking<br/>
about was written by Randy Hall.  But I'm honored to think someone<br/>
would think I could write such a book, however.  =)<br/>
<br/>
As for being redundant or not--it's pretty much the same material<br/>
you'll find on the websites.  For an experienced letterboxer, there's<br/>
not much you'll learn from it--though I've heard rumors that Randy has<br/>
some real live clues hidden in it.  Not that I've bothered to figure<br/>
out what they might be since he lives in Pennsylvania, or even know if<br/>
the rumors really are true or not.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
It's nice to have if you want to explain letterboxing to someone<br/>
without the use of websites, however.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

the book has pages throughout it for putting your own stamps.<br/>
Therefore, I have decided to make this book a postal letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I will carve a stamp for it this weekend.<br/>
If you want this "box" you have to email me your address.<br/>
I will mail the book &amp; stamp to you,<br/>
You post it back to me, and I will send it on to the next person who wants <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Black Cavalier is first, so email me your mailing address and I will carve <br/>
the stamp<br/>
this weekend and send it off to its first stop monday<br/>
