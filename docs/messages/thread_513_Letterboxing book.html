Hi,<br>
  I asked this in the Newboxers group a few weeks ago, but didn't get <br>
much of an answer.  Has anyone read Ryan Carpenter's Letterboxing <br>
book?  I'm curious if it has any information beyond what is available <br>
on the main LB sites (lb.org, aq.com, lb.info).  I'm thinking about <br>
getting it, but am worried it may be redundant since I've read all <br>
the tutorials & FAQs.<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
<br>

*hehe*  You both got the wrong Ryan.  I think the book you're talking<br>
about was written by Randy Hall.  But I'm honored to think someone<br>
would think I could write such a book, however.  =)<br>
<br>
As for being redundant or not--it's pretty much the same material<br>
you'll find on the websites.  For an experienced letterboxer, there's<br>
not much you'll learn from it--though I've heard rumors that Randy has<br>
some real live clues hidden in it.  Not that I've bothered to figure<br>
out what they might be since he lives in Pennsylvania, or even know if<br>
the rumors really are true or not.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
It's nice to have if you want to explain letterboxing to someone<br>
without the use of websites, however.<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>
<br>

the book has pages throughout it for putting your own stamps.<br>
Therefore, I have decided to make this book a postal letterbox.<br>
<br>
I will carve a stamp for it this weekend.<br>
If you want this "box" you have to email me your address.<br>
I will mail the book & stamp to you,<br>
You post it back to me, and I will send it on to the next person who wants <br>
it.<br>
<br>
Black Cavalier is first, so email me your mailing address and I will carve <br>
the stamp<br>
this weekend and send it off to its first stop monday<br>
