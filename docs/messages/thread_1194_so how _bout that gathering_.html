suggested Anthony Chabot Park in San Leandro (almost 5,000 acres with a lake <br>
and a shooting range)<br>

<br>
or Redwood Regional Park in Oakland (1,800 acres great trails, loads of shade)<br>

<br>
Does anyone have an opinion of this?  Selfishly, I would prefer a location <br>
closer to my home because Robb isn't up for long car rides, and a nearby <br>
location means that we would be able to stay at the event longer.  Also, there <br>
are *scads* of great letterboxes in the surrounding metropolitan area, so <br>
that while folks were scouting locations for planting, they could also scoop up <br>
some goodies!<br>
<br>
Of course, this is just *my* suggestion....<br>

Then, we think, by all means, you should select the venue! The more  <br>
Lisascenic and Robb, the better! Should we do more sleuthing for locations or is  one <br>
of these two good?<br>

<br>
As it turns out i still haven't had much time to think about this, but I<br>
thought I'd get some ideas out before too much more time went by.<br>
<br>
It looks to me like the main questions right now are:<br>
- location<br>
- date<br>
- activities (?)<br>
<br>
I'm all for taking this gathering somewhere new that isn't necessarily San<br>
Francisco-centric.  I'm definitely in favor of taking it somewhere that<br>
allows the maximum number of people to participate, factoring in distance,<br>
weather, and ease of use for all interested participants.  To that end,<br>
I'd suggest that Lisa's suggestion of the Redwood Regional Park in Oakland<br>
looks like it fits the bill, with lots of hiking trails, picnic tables<br>
with disabled-accessible areas, closer than SF (and no SF traffic!) for<br>
folks outside the Bay Area, but still in the BA so likely to be warm but<br>
not too warm.  We can reserve a picnic area if we choose, so we could<br>
start or top the day off with a potluck or picnic.<br>
<br>
If this doesn't appeal to anyone, other suggestions are welcome!<br>
<br>
As far as the date goes, I'd personally lean towards the end of August,<br>
mainly because I'll be away in early August and would like to at least<br>
have a weekend back in town before the gathering to finish preparations on<br>
any boxes I might make and actually go plant them. I am of course open to<br>
other dates - end of July or early September even, but end of August, the<br>
26th or 27th, seems like a good target to me.<br>
<br>
Considering activities, of course I assume folks will want to plant boxes<br>
and spend much of the time looking for boxes.  It being summer and the<br>
season of barbeques, would there be any interest in a potluck, picnic, or<br>
barbeque of some kind?  It would be a nice way to cap off a day and set<br>
some time aside for stamp exchanges.<br>
<br>
I know many of you have coordinated events in the past, so I urge you to<br>
please make suggestions, speak up, and generally let me know of your ideas<br>
and tips.  I'm perfectly happy to co-coordinate with anyone who wants to<br>
pitch in... I mainly wanted to get the ball rolling and help this happen.<br>
:)<br>
<br>
Looking forward to hearing from you all -<br>

Did you see the post about an east coast 'boxer here the end of July? <br>
it would be nice to include her and for us, Sunday, July 30th would be <br>
wonderful. We think Redwood Regional would be great and it's always <br>
nice to have people bring "something to share" food-wise. Wheather we <br>
have a BBQ main 'dish' or not depends on finding a person who's willing <br>
to 'man' the grill for a couple of hours minimum.<br>
<br>
I encourage everyone to put in for a date we can all vote on so a <br>
picnic site can be reserved (very important and the shadier the <br>
better!) Ours is Sunday, July 30.<br>
