San Francisco artist Rio Yanez hosted "The Great Tortilla Conspiracy"<br/>
at the De Young museum last week, inviting artists to come by and have<br/>
their art silkscreened onto tortillas with edible inks.<br/>
<br/>
How cool is that?<br/>

I grew up in Southern Calif. just south of Pasadena and was lucky enough to<br/>
attend several of the city's *Doo Dah<br/>
Parade*<http: www.pasadenadoodahparade.com=""></http:>s,<br/>
which mocks its more illustrious cousin, the Rose Parade. Some of the more<br/>
notable Doo Dah acts include Leg-Go, the One-Legged Clown, the Hard Hat<br/>
Brotherhood, the Spawn of Captain James T. Kirk, and the Men of Leisure<br/>
Synchronized Nap Team.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite parts of the parade was the Tortilla Fight.  Many people<br/>
brought printed tortillas to throw - often with funny pictures or quips<br/>
about tortillas or tortilla fight, as well as the occasional local business<br/>
ad.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a quick description of the event:<br/>
*One bizarre turn over the years was the fact that parade participants and<br/>
bystanders engaged in an escalating battle with flying tortillas. It started<br/>
out innocently enough as a messy street nuisance, but when the tortillas<br/>
were hardened in the heat one year, "people found themselves pelted and even<br/>
hurt until the city passed a No Tortillas ordinance. Pasadena's one of only<br/>
two cities in America to ban the tossing of tortillas in public.*<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea which other city has banned tortilla tossing, but found that<br/>
it has been banned at Texas Tech football games.<br/>
