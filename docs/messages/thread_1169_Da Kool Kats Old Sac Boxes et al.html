<br>
<br>
We've recently had reports that several of our boxes in Old Sac were<br>
missing or pulled.  This is incorrect.<br>
<br>
Last week-end, before my foot surgery, we "hopped" down there (ha!) to<br>
check on them.  All of our boxes in Old Sac are alive and well (better<br>
than I am feeling at this moment in time.)<br>
<br>
We acted like tourists and went in and asked for the box as directed<br>
in the clue.  In one of the establishments I had to give several clues<br>
and finally ask for the "stamp box" before they handed it over, but<br>
this is only because there were several new employees in the store. <br>
We have 3 boxes inside of stores plus our Old Landmark box "on the<br>
streets". <br>
<br>
While we were down there, we checked on Lee and Nancy's Pony Express<br>
and Eagle Theater plus artTrekker's boxes.  Sierra Sally, sorry we<br>
didn't have time to check on yours.  I feel reasonablly sure that your<br>
Wells Fargo Stage is safe and hope all is well with .<br>
<br>
Two weeks ago, returning from Reno via Tahoe we checked on Bridal Veil<br>
Falls since there was a report of it not being found.  It was in<br>
excellent condition and totally safe and dry, surviving a nearby rock<br>
slide.  It will be awhile before we can check on our other waterfall<br>
boxes.  There will be three more in this series as soon as we are able<br>
to get out to plant.  <br>
<br>
Last night we checked on Very First Mug.  It has had very few<br>
visitors, but was where it should be and in good condition. <br>

We found Sierra Sally's box dry and well just a couple of months ago.<br>
