<br>
This is very last minute, I know.  I had hoped to plant a box for the <br>
GRR this Saturday, but I wasn't able to get out to the area early,<br>
and <br>
in looking at photographs of the site, it didn't look like it would<br>
be <br>
possible to decide from afar where to plant the box exactly the<br>
morning <br>
of and have clues ready in advance.  <br>
<br>
I have decided, then, to just bring the box with me as a traveler.  <br>
Anyone who can tell me the first destination of the 3pm stagecoach<br>
will <br>
be allowed to stamp into the box.  (And here's hoping that the <br>
information I received is still up to date!.....)<br>
<br>
See you tomorrow!  La Loka<br>
