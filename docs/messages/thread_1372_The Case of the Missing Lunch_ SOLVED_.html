<br/>
  Hey Carole,<br/>
<br/>
  When I got back from getting those crazy cows, your groovy wheeled<br/>
  ice chest was behind my car &amp; everyone was gone (was Digger trying<br/>
  to get in on the good stuff? :-D). Not to worry, contact Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue<br/>
  to retrieve it. It is at their house. I didn't notice a name on it, maybe I'll<br/>
  send you a nice luggage tag for it. =)<br/>
<br/>
  What am I doing posting at this unholy hour? I was keyed up when I<br/>
  got home and made the mistake of digging up all the brouhaha on Blue<br/>
  Diamonds. Yikes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just can't imagine getting so worked<br/>
  up about somebody trying to make improvements to something that is<br/>
  basically a service to us. Ok, now don't get me started... Well, I did get<br/>
  a pretty good laugh from Crunchy Mama's example for possible BD logbooks:<br/>
  "organic hand-harvested sustainable hemp sewn together with their own hair"<br/>
  har har!!! M R duks!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, just ignore all that, I'm a little punchy. It was great to see everyone,<br/>
  and be reminded, yet again, what a great bunch of people usually gets<br/>
  together for this lunatic pursuit. As I said in the logbook of Vacas Locas,<br/>
  "Love(d) the shoes, love(d) the hat, love(d) the dress, love(d) it all!"<br/>
  (Love Rupert Everett in My Best Friend's Wedding!) OMG, punchy!!!<br/>
<br/>
  na-nite, aT                        <br/>
