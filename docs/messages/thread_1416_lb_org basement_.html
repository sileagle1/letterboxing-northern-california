I believe that it is a "basement" listing of letterbox clues that <br>
have been archived by the planters. It is not the original basement <br>
that was created when the webmasters switched over to the present <br>
web site. I would imagine that this current basement is a collection <br>
of clues to locations where there are no letterboxes. That is unlike <br>
the previous basement.<br>
I never could understand why one would archive clues instead of <br>
delete them. If you aren't going to replant why archive? If you are <br>
going to replant why archive, just go and replant.<br>

That I suppose is the reason for archiving, but the count at LbNA <br>
can't possibly be accurate with or without archiving clues. We just <br>
delete the ones we are not going to replant.<br>
