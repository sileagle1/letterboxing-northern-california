It is next to a river, rivers have rocks and having run many rivers I can always find rocks in rivers, or at least it seems that way. BTW you might put in your clues that there is a trailer turn around at the end of that road. Without that notification there is a little apprehension when you start pulling  a trailer past the main parking lot.<br>
