<br>
Thanks for your notes and concern. We were evacuated yesterday and  <br>
have been staying with friends. I had time to load up most of my art,  <br>
computer, papers and the dogs, help some neighbors, water plants, and  <br>
forget some basic things before leaving. I don't think we'll be able  <br>
to get back home for at east a couple more days. Our neighborhood is  <br>
fine (I think), but the hardest hit area is only about a half mile  <br>
away, and the power lines are down and things are a mess. We are  <br>
talking five minutes from my house. We have close friends and many  <br>
acquaintances who have lost their homes. So far we are only getting  <br>
word of mouth news, tv news (erk!) and haven't seen the devastation  <br>
first-hand. I know that when we do, the shock will really set in. As  <br>
far as I know, there have been no injuries and only pets have  <br>
perished. That is a tough one to take, but still minimal compared to  <br>
the potential loss of life. The wind was so strong yesterday, that  <br>
fire whipped up so fast. We've been on the phone quite a bit, trying  <br>
to check in with everyone. Then last night, a Tahoe moment, as a large  <br>
bear strolled across the lawns across the street. Stir crazy today...I  <br>
have my logbooks, but not my carving tools, and, as they really want  <br>
people staying off the streets until they get this thing in hand, this  <br>
would be the perfect opportunity to carve. Dang. The smoke has eased  <br>
up some this evening, hardly notice it. I guess the copters have  <br>
stopped for the day. Just hoping the wind doesn't pick up again.<br>
<br>
Gotta go for now, but I'll check in soon, Kel<br>
<br>
oh, both businesses are fine.<br>

I guess the bears are being displaced by all the commotion, as well?<br>

Thanks for checking in. I'm sure you have more on your mind than the<br>
worries of us letterboxers.<br>

I know this and feel the same way. I hadn't gotten to a computer till<br>
I sent that update. We spent the first 18 hours glued to phones and<br>
neighbor's tvs. They let us back into the neighborhood this morning--<br>
so much smoke! Especially in the house. I'm kind of on alert right<br>
now, the wind seems to be changing, picking up, and there are helicopters<br>
flying back and forth right over my house. I didn't unpack my car yet,<br>
and probably should give a little more thought to what I might need to<br>
get out now.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad I got to meet up with AZRoadie and Desert Flower for a walk<br>
Sunday morning at Fallen Leaf Lake. They enjoyed Don's Got Deet? series<br>
and then were evacuated from the campground by mid-afternoon. Don--I'm<br>
still hoping to see you guys, have to re-check your dates. Next week?<br>
<br>
These copters are making me nervous; I'll sign off for now. Kel<br>
