Had quite the coincidence yesteray and just had to share it. Mutau <br/>
Paul and I went up to Auburn to replace the log book on my North <br/>
Fork Dry Diggins box and since he hadn't stamped in on the Old <br/>
Auburn box we looked it up too. Inside we found Art treker's "Julie <br/>
is 40" hitchhiker. Which was amazing because yesterday was my 40th <br/>
birthday.. what's the chances?  (actually it was not my 40th it was <br/>
the first anniversary of my 39th birthday)<br/>
<br/>
Keep boxin!<br/>

So cool!! And, hey! We were in Auburn this weekend replacing the full log <br/>
book in our I-80 Series #1 box in Auburn too! So close! Could have gotten an <br/>
exchange if we'd known!<br/>
