coyotl clan. Am I correct? Thanks for a very lovely hike whoever it is....Funhog<br>

much nicer and the waterfall prettier in the rainy season.  I hope <br>
you had the chance to take in the other waterfalls.  You are right <br>
that this box was planted by Coyotl Clan.  We are glad you <br>
enjoyed it. <br>
