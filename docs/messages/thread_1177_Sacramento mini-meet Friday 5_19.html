Aahz, how and when are you driving?  You wouldn't be passing through<br>
Alameda County by any chance?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry Lisa.  The main reason for the trip is that Zaira has a school field<br>
trip to Sac.  I'm chaperoning.  We're leaving Gilroy at 5am and I'm<br>
convoying with a school bus, so am not really sure what route we're taking,<br>
though I assume it's I-5.  Then Z and I are spending the night in Sac,<br>
planting some Sac boxes the next day, then hunting on the way home.<br>
<br>
If any are planning/hoping to make it, Carole from Da Kool Kats has my cell<br>
# if needed, though Z and I should be there before 7 so we can decipher what<br>
there is of Black Cavalier's box.  I'll be wearing one of the "Get A Clue.<br>
Go Letterboxing tshirts from Silent Doug's site and should have a bright<br>
yellow messenger bag with me.<br>
<br>
Hoping to see as many as possible.<br>
