is surrounded by thistles and I was ecologically insensitive when I <br/>
placed it.  So glad to hear the famous stamp was found...it is a tiny <br/>
work of art and deserves to be seen in many, many more logbooks <br/>

I did stop in the rain today to check on the new sculpture show at <br/>
Paradise Ridge Sculpture Garden.  IT is a fantastic show with works by <br/>
internationally and nationally recognized artists like McArthur genius <br/>
grant recipient Ned Kahn (although his piece was pretty vanilla).  The <br/>
best piece of the show was the poetry house by Bruce Johnson.  It is a <br/>
takeoff on a Japanese tearoom and was built by hand from a single old <br/>
growth redwood and it is incredible.  <br/>
<br/>
It is also a stone's throw (literally) from the letterbox there.  I <br/>
checked on it and only 3 visitors in almost a year.  And the clue is a <br/>
haiku!  How serendipitious is  that.....someone goes and builds a <br/>
poetry house next door.  Put it on your list to nab while the show is <br/>
on and you can enjoy some great art as well. The wine is pretty good <br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
Carole and Gary....I have used up all your great containers...and <br/>
can't find any of the korean tupperware ones at the asian markets near <br/>
me...can I send you money for some more?  And the walmart, Kmart, <br/>
Sportmart stores near me dont carry camo tape....I guess Sonoma County <br/>
is not into hunting enough...<br/>

I didn't however see the sig stamp.  I take it that someone found it where?   Close to one of the 4 creatures?  Michelle<br/>
