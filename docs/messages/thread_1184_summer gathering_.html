I have yet to meet any of your or exchange stamps with anyone other than<br/>
friends whom I've introduced to LB'ing (though I hope to break that streak<br/>
meeting Da Kool Kats this weekend!), would anyone be interested in a<br/>
gathering/picnic/bbq/etc sometime this summer?  I would happily carve an<br/>
event stamp and with enough lead-in time folks could hide LB's for the<br/>
event.  Golden Gate Park is a natural choice for such a thing but SF has<br/>
so many beautiful parks that it need not be the only place to consider..<br/>
<br/>
Just throwing this out there for consideration... thoughts?  Dates? <br/>
Picnic or restaurant?  None of the above? :)<br/>

a) there has already been a gathering there, a few years back<br/>

letterboxing ( I could be dead-wrong about this, though...)<br/>

I'm happy to carve, and bring treats, but I just don't have the <br/>

Not sure about the rules in GG Park, but I do have a friend who is a Park<br/>
Ranger, so I'll ask her if there are better/permissible spots for this<br/>
sort of activity.  I know she'll have some helpful advice.  There are also<br/>
several (well, at least two for sure, if not more) boxes currently hidden<br/>
in the park, but I too am unaware as to the legality of this.  I know<br/>
there was a gathering in GG park previously, but it's a huge place and<br/>
obvious choice. My Ranger friend may have a better suggestion, though.<br/>
<br/>
I know your plate is very full so no worries about being unable to run the<br/>
show this time. :)  I'm glad, though, to hear you were hoping someone<br/>
would do this!  I think it would be fun.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like the idea of another gathering (I think we are due one since that last one was Old Sac <br/>
in April 2005) - I believe there were rumblings about doing one in Fairfield or the North <br/>
Bay but I haven't heard anything more.  I'm all for doing the East Bay again (eg Redwood <br/>
Park as DS&amp;OB suggest) but that would be selfishly motivated.  Coyote Hills doesn't really <br/>
offer as many hiding spots as Redwood.  The other idea I had was Monterey as there is a <br/>
good size population of boxes down there.  Ultimately it will depend on who wants to take <br/>
this ball and run with it!  August is good for me.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the boxes in GGP are vestiges of the 2004 event (although quite a few of them are <br/>
gone).  Paul in SF clarified at the time that only the shoreline area is considered part of the <br/>
NPS so it's not all national land.  EIther way, most of us were fairly oblique about the <br/>
location in our clues.<br/>
