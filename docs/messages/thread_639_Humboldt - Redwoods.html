- If anyone goes to the Redwoods to site-see or letterbox, that are ALSO <br/>
coming to the Gold Rush Romp on 30 April, could you do me a HUGE favor?!!!<br/>
<br/>
At many of the redwood shops they had souvenirs for sale.  My son really <br/>
wanted a wooden yo-yo.  He decided to wait and see what all the shops <br/>
had to offer.  We were going to home via south 101 but never went back <br/>
that way (like we said we would be) but went North and over to I5 and <br/>
back south on I5.   Anyway, I thought I'd surprise him with a yo-yo so <br/>
he had something to remember our recent vacation. <br/>
<br/>
Contact me off-list so I can arrange to pay you at the "Romp" - should <br/>
only be about $5 or so.  THANKS bunches!<br/>
