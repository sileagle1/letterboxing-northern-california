We had thought that it might be fun to drive to Lodi, and check out<br/>
the wineries and birds.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone make any particular suggestions of places to visit?  I<br/>
can't remember the name of the nature sanctuary in Lodi.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions of places to stop between Oakland and Lodi would be<br/>
appreciated, too.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if my friend will be tempted by letterboxing, but I'll<br/>
certainly accept clues, and see if she "bites."<br/>

<br/>
You might be thinking of the Cosumnes River Preserve, off of Hwy 5 <br/>
north of Lodi.  There is also a letterbox in Lodi at a winery not too <br/>
far east of Hwy. 99.  Wish we were there to welcome you, but we'll <br/>
still be out of the area this coming weekend.  Hope you feel better <br/>
soon. <br/>
