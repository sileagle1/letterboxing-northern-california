                    <div class="plaintext-content">I actually made a point to go boxing today (and go see the corpse lily <br/>
blooming at the UC Botanical Gardens, and check on a rumored vandalism <br/>
of Upsadaisium.  Bagged 2-4 of Amazon and Volcano, box 1 out of bounds <br/>
to visitors as some construction is going on....Very nice work Lea and <br/>
Black bird.  <br/>
<br/>
You all should check out lisascnic mini box...great stamp, fun spot.  <br/>
<br/>
The lily was cool and huge as advertised,,,but it stopped smelling a <br/>
few days back.  And the box and (paper toweling inside it) was as I <br/>
left it at LAwrtence Hall of Science, but the stamp and logbook <br/>
gone...hmmm perhpas there is a geocache nearby and someone got <br/>
confused.  Anyway.....theer is a new box to replace OUTSIDE of the  <br/>
museum so need to pay admission.  Just a quickie I actually carved in <br/>
the car and assembled on the spot, so dont get your hopes up.  ATlas <br/>
quest seem not to be responding but will get clues posted soon.   <br/>
