Atlas Quest www.atlasquest.com/ has many of the same clues as LBNA, but there may be some that are not listed at LBNA. There are some private web sites that have clues listed. When we decide on which area to head on our trips then generally I will post a note on the regional list in the area we are headed to, and I will ask for a list of any new letterboxes or any WOM (word of mouth) clues that we can have. You can try googling letterbox sites. Since you posted on the LbNCA list I'm assuming that you are in CA., have you run out of letterboxes in your area?<br>

  You can always use the first one as an example, and look around for a suitable hiding spot. Beside the usual semi remote spots, you can hide letterboxes in parks or even in the middle of the city. We have hidden letterboxes with magnets holding the box to the underside of USPS mailboxes, under metal stairs, behind metal signs,and inside of fake rocks. Just look around and use your imagination. Some of the most difficult spots are urban locations, but they still viable. We have several at Long Beach State that have been in place since early 2001, and the traffic around the campus is huge. Don't be detered, just get yourself a stamp(carve one or go store bought) and figure out a good plant. <br>
  When we got started there were only 14 in California, and you might have to travel a short distance  to look for a box, but not as far a distance as we had to go.<br>

The thing is, if there are letterboxes in a certain location, then <br>
Letterboxers will visit that location. When other letterboxers visit, <br>
they often leave behind more hidden letterboxes and/or hitchhikers. <br>
So by planting letterboxes, you are helping to bring more letterboxes <br>
and letterboxers into your area.  <br>
