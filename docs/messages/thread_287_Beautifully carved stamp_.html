My compliments to Blackbird!  <br/>
<br/>
We happened to go to Chabot on Sunday and went after the Fairy Ring.  <br/>
A beautiful stamp and another wonderful hitchiker both carved by <br/>
Blackbird.  Of course, I did not have a pen to sign and date the book, <br/>
so tried to write a date with my dauberduo.....not easy.  I have <br/>
learned to leave several pens in my stampkit, but they seem to always <br/>
migrate elsewhere.....<br/>
