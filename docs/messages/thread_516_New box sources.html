Hi,<br/>
  With the help of Da Kool Kats, I've finally found a temporary <br/>
source for the Milan Classic (Silent Dougerware) containers &amp; an <br/>
airtight container from Korea that looks incredible  I posted about <br/>
them over on the BoxHeads group.  Here's the links.<br/>

<br/>
Carole said the Linens &amp; Things at Citrus Heights seemed to have more <br/>
of the Milan Classics than the one in Folsom.  I checkted the L&amp;T <br/>
last week &amp; I didn't see any there, so either they didn't get any or <br/>
got them just recently.  &amp; this is a 1 time purchase of the Milan <br/>
Classic containers, they won't be back once they're gone.<br/>

look very good - sturdy, air/water tight and they come<br/>

of these.<br/>

The lock &amp; lock boxes look like what I found last week<br/>

look very good - sturdy, air/water tight and they come<br/>
in convenient sizes. I bought several for my future<br/>
