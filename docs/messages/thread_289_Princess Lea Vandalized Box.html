If this box is close enough to get to and you can check on it, perhaps <br/>
you should. <br/>
It's very possible that he was only trying get a reaction and the box is <br/>
still safe.<br/>
<br/>
If not, this could explain why so many boxes come up missing.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your fears are for naught.<br/>
