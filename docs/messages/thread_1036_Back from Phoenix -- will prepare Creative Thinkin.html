                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all.... I'm back, and will start work on the workshop. I see it's <br>
for the 28th... This week, I'll confirm the location. If not the <br>
Presidio, it will be at one of two other cafes here in town. The <br>
Presidio shoulbe be fine --- lots of parking there. Will confirm & <br>
post.<br>
<br>
** Remember: I'm willing to teach a second session for those wqho <br>
can't make this one.<br>
<br>
So will people who are seriously planning to attend please e-mail <br>
me, so I can get an idea of who's coming?<br>
<br>
Also, look back at my previous post where I give you some pre-work <br>
to do. It's interesting, and will help us in in workshop, and will <br>
serve you well going forward. In summary, you need to 1) write down <br>
your own definition of what a letterbox is. 2) Then list any and all <br>
possible attributes of a letterbox, such as weight, shape, size, <br>
hiding spot, clues, and so on. List any many as you can, then try to <br>
come up with more by revisiting your list a couple of days later. <br>
3)Then make a list of topics and things that interest you, including <br>
things such as geographic places, periods of history, art and <br>
architecture styles, things in nature, myths and stories, famous <br>
people or characters, etc. <br>
Here's an small piece of my list:<br>
 <br>
Versailles   fountains   Venice   opera sets   Ancient Rome   <br>
India   Spice Trade   the Crusades   the Silk Road   Atlantis   <br>
Petra, Jordan  Superstitions   Fireworks  Eden   Art Deco   <br>
Boticelli  primitive masks   Alexander the Great   Harvest   the <br>
Circus   Charlatans and Hoaxes   Optical Illusions   the Green Man   <br>
Paul Klee   Kandinsky   Mazes and labyrinths   Pinball   Totem poles<br>
<br>
You get the idea... the longer the list, the better. This list will <br>
come in handy for many projects and things besides letterboxing, too.<br>
<br>
Please don't procrastinate, start your pre-work now! And bring to <br>
the workshop. Also bring along any notes or thoughts you have <br>
about 'edgy' or unusual boxes you've thought about.<br>
<br>
I MAY (not guaranteed) have a groundbreaklingly different type of <br>
box ready by the 28th, called 'Tabula Rasa'. It's based on the <br>
theory that letterboxing can profoundly change peoples' lives for <br>
the better. It's an experiment, and I hope you'll participate.<br>
<br>
More soon....<br>
<br>
Ciao!<br>
