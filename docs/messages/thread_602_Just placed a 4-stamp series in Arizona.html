It's been a long time since I've posted on the NorCal group. How's it <br>
going DoubleSaj, Old Blue, Princess Lea, Amanda, Ryan? I've recently <br>
returned from a fishing trip outside of Yuma, Arizona, and since <br>
Arizona doesn't seem to have its own LB Group, I'm announcing my <br>
letterboxes where I can. It's a 4-stamp series planted along Highway <br>
95 outside of Yuma, and the clues are newly posted on Atlas Quest and <br>
Letterboxing.org, so please check them out if any of you are <br>
traveling to the Sonora Desert. I hear it's really beautiful out <br>
there in July and August--NOT--hope the damn stamps don't melt. Can <br>
you imagine opening up the box and finding a Mastercarve puddle?<br>
