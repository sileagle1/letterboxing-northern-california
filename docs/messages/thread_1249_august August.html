<br>
I think artTrekker's on to someting here... how about the name "'Boxing by<br>
the Dock of the Bay"? :)<br>
<br>
Name suggestions I've gathered (serious and not):<br>
<br>
Dawg Days (by the Bay)<br>
Urbal Essences<br>
UrbaLB<br>
Hot August Sights<br>
Hot August Delights<br>
Bump City<br>
Urb'in It Up<br>
Gumshoe Gathering<br>
S.T.E.A.L.T.H. (SummerTime Extravaganza And Letterboxing Total Hoorah) or<br>
some other arbitrary but fun acronym.<br>
Any Port in a Storm<br>
Safe Harbor<br>
Harboring Fugitives<br>
'Boxing by the Dock of the Bay<br>
MHSP (or Oakland) (or Bay Area) Eat and Greet<br>
<br>
I dislike making executive decisions (reason #83232 not to be a leader<br>
:))! I'm not crazy about Dog/Dawg Days since it's being used elsewhere,<br>
but that's about the strongest feeling I have.  I don't want to make<br>
another poll at this point if I can help it.<br>
<br>
I could tie this in with the idea of the Stamp Exchange (which I like):<br>
before we can exchange event stamps, someone needs to carve one.  Who is<br>
going to carve it?  Are any of you up to this challenge, and if so, do any<br>
of these names strike you?  I'm inclined to let the gathering name be up<br>
to the event stamp carver.  Let's pick a name, asap!<br>
<br>
The gathering will be at Middle Harbor Shoreline Park in Oakland on<br>
Sunday, August 27th.  Again, we need a name, stat!  I want to get this<br>
event registered on AQ asap - in fact, I might go ahead and put a<br>
placeholder there and change the name later.  Also, time to start visiting<br>
the park and planning your LBs for the event, if you are planting!<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for one of you 13 volunteers to contact me to say you<br>
are available to help with some aspect of organization.  Lea pointed out<br>
that folks often show up with their own clues, so perhaps a Box<br>
Coordinator isn't a required position... but please, can someone step up<br>
to help organize the Potluck?  I will be making reservations for a BBQ pit<br>
at MHSP for the 27th if possible, and it would be great to have someone<br>
help me gather a headcount and get the menu going.<br>
<br>
I'll be out of town in sunny FL for a few days starting Tuesday, so my<br>
access to email will be limited.  I'll send email on Monday with the<br>
details of our reservation at MHSP.  If any of you want to step up at<br>
anytime and just get things going with the potluck or any other aspect,<br>
please do. :)<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Both Lea and artTrekker have proposed carving the event stamp - so you two<br>

I'll go ahead and write something up on AQ for the event and tomorrow<br>
