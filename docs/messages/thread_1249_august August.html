<br/>
I think artTrekker's on to someting here... how about the name "'Boxing by<br/>
the Dock of the Bay"? :)<br/>
<br/>
Name suggestions I've gathered (serious and not):<br/>
<br/>
Dawg Days (by the Bay)<br/>
Urbal Essences<br/>
UrbaLB<br/>
Hot August Sights<br/>
Hot August Delights<br/>
Bump City<br/>
Urb'in It Up<br/>
Gumshoe Gathering<br/>
S.T.E.A.L.T.H. (SummerTime Extravaganza And Letterboxing Total Hoorah) or<br/>
some other arbitrary but fun acronym.<br/>
Any Port in a Storm<br/>
Safe Harbor<br/>
Harboring Fugitives<br/>
'Boxing by the Dock of the Bay<br/>
MHSP (or Oakland) (or Bay Area) Eat and Greet<br/>
<br/>
I dislike making executive decisions (reason #83232 not to be a leader<br/>
:))! I'm not crazy about Dog/Dawg Days since it's being used elsewhere,<br/>
but that's about the strongest feeling I have.  I don't want to make<br/>
another poll at this point if I can help it.<br/>
<br/>
I could tie this in with the idea of the Stamp Exchange (which I like):<br/>
before we can exchange event stamps, someone needs to carve one.  Who is<br/>
going to carve it?  Are any of you up to this challenge, and if so, do any<br/>
of these names strike you?  I'm inclined to let the gathering name be up<br/>
to the event stamp carver.  Let's pick a name, asap!<br/>
<br/>
The gathering will be at Middle Harbor Shoreline Park in Oakland on<br/>
Sunday, August 27th.  Again, we need a name, stat!  I want to get this<br/>
event registered on AQ asap - in fact, I might go ahead and put a<br/>
placeholder there and change the name later.  Also, time to start visiting<br/>
the park and planning your LBs for the event, if you are planting!<br/>
<br/>
I'm still waiting for one of you 13 volunteers to contact me to say you<br/>
are available to help with some aspect of organization.  Lea pointed out<br/>
that folks often show up with their own clues, so perhaps a Box<br/>
Coordinator isn't a required position... but please, can someone step up<br/>
to help organize the Potluck?  I will be making reservations for a BBQ pit<br/>
at MHSP for the 27th if possible, and it would be great to have someone<br/>
help me gather a headcount and get the menu going.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be out of town in sunny FL for a few days starting Tuesday, so my<br/>
access to email will be limited.  I'll send email on Monday with the<br/>
details of our reservation at MHSP.  If any of you want to step up at<br/>
anytime and just get things going with the potluck or any other aspect,<br/>
please do. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, you caught me out on my Libran tendencies: indecisiveness and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; eagerness to please. :) I've gotten a lot of positive reassurance<br/>
&gt; &gt; lately<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so I guess I'll go ahead and make the call:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please join us for the Bay Area Shoreline Shindig on Sunday,<br/>
&gt; &gt; August 27th<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at Middle Harbor Shoreline Park in Oakland, CA, starting at noon!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Both Lea and artTrekker have proposed carving the event stamp - so<br/>
&gt; &gt; you two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; should figure it out between you. Maybe aT should carve it so as<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there with us in spirit?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll go ahead and write something up on AQ for the event and<br/>
&gt; &gt; tomorrow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; after I call the park I'll let you all know if we got a BBQ pit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks everyone!<br/>
