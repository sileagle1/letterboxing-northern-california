Since not all boxes planted for a Gathering can be left in place, <br/>
what do people do with them?  Are they permanently retired to make <br/>
the stamp extra-rare?  Are they turned into postal boxes?  Are they <br/>
replanted at a new site?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Hi B.C.<br/>
We left all of our letterboxes in place after the Kernville <br/>
gathering except the one everyone forgot to look for without some <br/>
major hints. That was the one planted at the end of our driveway, <br/>
and everyone walked right by it when they came to the BBQ. That <br/>
letterbox ended up in Idaho at a ghost town setting. The letterbox <br/>
is called Gold Strike and would have been a good fit for the GRR. <br/>
BugZ is planting one for us at the GRR, and will be sending it back <br/>
to us. We have a few sites here in Kernville that the stamp image <br/>
will be  perfect for those sites. You could use your stamps for <br/>
another location, or use them as HHers.<br/>

I have a letterbox that I hid specifically for a mystery gathering <br/>
here in Seattle and I am planning to rehide it as a letterbox, just <br/>
in a different location. (In fact, it was originally a lone letterbox <br/>
and it will now be part of a series!)<br/>
