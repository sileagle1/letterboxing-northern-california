                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have friends who are serial counters.  Every summer at the Opera, my<br>
assistant Sheila and I would play a silly game of "who saw more deer?"<br>
She took this way, way more seriously than I ever did.  She had<br>
separate counts for live, dead and taxidermy.  (I could never figure<br>
that one out....how many deer parts = a deer?) <br>
<br>
This past year, I read a couple of books of competitive bird watchers<br>
and the lists they make ("Kingbird Highway" and "The Big Year") but<br>
found the whole idea of COMPETITIVE BIRD WATCHING just too bizarre.<br>
<br>
I've never kept track of my letterbox finds, either.  I enjoy the<br>
experience, and love having people's art in my logbook, but never sat<br>
down to tally my finds.  Actually, I started once, on a cross country<br>
drive, but got bogged down by all the types of letterboxes, and gave up.<br>
<br>
So, why am I blathering on about all this?<br>
<br>
Because, today, when Robb and I went out so he could do some walking,<br>
and we found what Atlas Quest calls my two hundredth letterbox.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to Team Tysonosaurus!  The House of the Hill is a delightful<br>
letterbox, which we finally found by poking around with Robb's<br>
trekking poles.<br>
<br>
So for one day, I'll note my "score."  Obviously, I can't compete with<br>
some others on this forum, but that's not why I letterbox in the first<br>
place.<br>
