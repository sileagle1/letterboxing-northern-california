This is for those of you that has solved and attempted the Lemony Snickett Mystery Box in CA.<br>
My son and family just returned from Florida where they picked up the stamp from the <br>
Reptile Room. Since they were back there, they took in a few of the theme parks,<br>
although Lemony was their main goal.  My grandson doesn't know this!! <br>
<br>
I am hoping to get them to relate their story for all of you.  It involves alligators, pigmy<br>
rattlesnakes, wild boar and a 3 hour walk in torrential rains, underwear and a 40lb turtle.<br>
<br>
The story may be forth coming.  Maybe they should post it to the National Group.<br>
