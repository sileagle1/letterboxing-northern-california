Hi all!<br>
<br>
The series I think Grumpy Grinch is referring to is the Fresno <br>
County multicultural series by Sierra Sally. The little Jiggs' and I <br>
did this series (all 11 in about 4 hours - and 100 or so miles of <br>
driving!) We were first finders of the last 8 in the series. We <br>
thoroughly recommend it to anyone, but I do know tha Sally had a <br>
heck of a time keeping track of so many boxes! Might be food for <br>
thought for anyone else thinking of putting together such an <br>
ambitious project. Come to think of it, the California Missions (of <br>
which we only got one or two before moving) falls in the same <br>
category...anyone close to getting all of those? Just curious!<br>
<br>
Impatiently waiting for the snow and ice to melt up here!<br>
<br>
Pete aka Jiggs<br>
