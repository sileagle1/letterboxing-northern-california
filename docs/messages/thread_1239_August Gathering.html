Lea makes a good point about trees and hiding spots, and especially the<br>
longevity of boxes and being able to leave them somewhere.  I love the<br>
idea of Shoreline Park, but maybe we should go with our original choice<br>
this first time around, and revisit the idea of MHSP next time?  What say<br>
you all?<br>
<br>
Lisa, is Redwood Regional still an acceptable option for you and Robb?  Is<br>
it accessible enough?  I want our gathering to work out for everyone!<br>
<br>
Bump City is a great and original idea; I'd never heard of that term<br>
before.  I was thinking that if we moved it back to Redwood Regional, we<br>
could call it "Summer Breeze in the Trees"!<br>
<br>
Please, weigh in with your locale and name opinions, and soon!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To clarify my comment about the Middle harbor Park being "wide <br>
open," what I meant is that this type of park requires thinking like <br>
a stealthy urban letterboxer, because there are fewer spots <br>
forhiding big honkin' tupperware boxes.  I saw *lots* of great <br>
hiding places.  In fact, I was delighted at the options.  I think <br>
that teh Sacramento gathering offered the same sort of challenges, <br>
albeit on a larger scale.<br>
<br>
BUT TO BE TOTALLY SELFISH....<br>
<br>
I have to cast my vote for the Middle Harbor Park.<br>
<br>
While the picnic site at Redwood is accessible, the rest of that <br>
park isn't.  So that means that Robb would be stuck at the picnic <br>
table during the entire gathering.  Not terribly interesting for him.<br>
<br>
The flat terrain and paved trails at Middle Harbor provide Robb the <br>
ability to participate in this event, and not be left sitting on his <br>
butt while we all run around.<br>
<br>
I really don't think the park will be too hot.  Quite the contrary.  <br>
There was a stiff bay breeze blowing the day we were there.  I think <br>
this could be cooler than the hills.<br>
<br>
This is, of course, just my preference.  <br>

ps -- Lock Wench has offered a letterbox that relates to the Port of <br>
Oakland.  If you know her work, this is a pretty big incentive!<br>

speak up.  I think for a gathering, the most important thing is the <br>
company of our fellow boxers and the enjoyment of the event for each <br>
and every one of us.  I don't think that the permanence of boxes <br>
should be the overriding priority-- Permanent boxes can be placed <br>
any old time and if there is great concern, the event boxes can be <br>
temporary and replaced in a safer place after the event (like the <br>
one last year!)<br>
<br>
I think that we should try hard to be accomodating here and make it <br>
fun for our less mobile parties, get creative, and do this shindig <br>
at a place where there will be fun for all (sitting at a picnic site <br>
while everyone else is out hunting is so NOT fun) especially to give <br>
access to some of the locals who have made the East Bay one of the <br>
most creative, fun places to box in the Bay area--- <br>
<br>
My vote:  Call it anything you want, but let's consider Redwood <br>
Regional for another time and do Shoreline Park this year!!<br>

redwoods and hiding places are not likely to be permanent, how about<br>
turning it into something more like the Gabbering we had last summer<br>
at Mimulus' and not hide any boxes, but turn it into a Traveling Stamp<br>
Event.  Everyone could carve a traveling stamp or two and bring clues<br>
or post clues in advance.  These stamps can be placed elsewhere, if<br>
you choose, at a later date.  This way we will be able to stay<br>
together as a group and spend more time getting acquainted and/or<br>

Redwood Regional Park.  Please remember to vote!<br>
<br>
I think, since we are currently leaning towards MHSP, I would like to<br>
encourage everyone (per Carole's suggestion) to create personal travelers<br>
and cooties and stamps that can be exchanged in a group, AS WELL AS<br>
encouraging those of you who are so inclined to plant.  I think it would<br>
be nice to have lot of stamps to exhange amongst us but also have some<br>
planted boxes to encourage interested folks to explore the park and<br>
satisfy their 'boxing urges.<br>
<br>
I haven't heard any better name suggestions than something I tossed out<br>
like "Summer Boxing by the Bay" - surely someone can do better than this?!<br>

Regardless of the venue, I would like to urge restraint when it comes to cooties!  I got to <br>

compulsive about collecting them all (I was guilty of this).  Their original intent was to <br>

boxing without interference.  I heard a rumor that there was a series of cooties at the NY <br>
gathering that represented the alphabet - so I guess there were 26 of them.  That's a bit <br>
much!  So, cooties are cool, but too many cooties gets to be a bit annoying.  <br>

Hi all! Still up here in the PNW after the Stargazer's gathering (which was WONDERFUL BTW!) We've logged in our vote for venue and thought we'd chime in with an idea for the name. We could always just change the spelling to "Dawg Daze" or even "Dawg Daze by The Bay". It's nice to have something of an inspiration for carving ideas and a bunch of doggy stamps (not necessarily ALL, of course) would be adorable. (Think "Hog Heaven") "Breeze in the Trees" doesn't move us.<br>
<br>
Oh, Oh--how about "Hot August Sights" or "Hot August Delights"?<br>
<br>
Whatever. We'll love anything you all decide.<br>

As of today, 80% of votes are for the Shoreline Park, and 20% are for the<br>
Redwood Regional Park. Please remember to vote!<br>
<br>
I think, since we are currently leaning towards MHSP, I would like to<br>
encourage everyone (per Carole's suggestion) to create personal travelers<br>
and cooties and stamps that can be exchanged in a group, AS WELL AS<br>
encouraging those of you who are so inclined to plant. I think it would<br>
be nice to have lot of stamps to exhange amongst us but also have some<br>
planted boxes to encourage interested folks to explore the park and<br>
satisfy their 'boxing urges.<br>
<br>
I haven't heard any better name suggestions than something I tossed out<br>
like "Summer Boxing by the Bay" - surely someone can do better than this?!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So here is what we are thinking. We could do it July 28, any of the <br>
August Saturdays or the first two September Saturdays. If we do it <br>
between the 17th of August and the 3rd of September there is another <br>
attraction for out-of-towners to come. (The State Fair) But any of <br>
them would be fine. We will be going out of town one of the weekends <br>
but we haven't decided which and we could work it around what would <br>
be most convenient for everyone else. We are leaning towards having <br>
it at William Pond Park. That way it's on the bike trail and people <br>
could hide boxes in Goethe or William pond as they are just across <br>
the river from each other. William Pond has a covered picnic area <br>
that's why we are leaning towards it. Thoughts on the location would <br>
be greatly appreciated as would everyone's choices of dates. Maybe <br>
everyone could pick the top 2 dates that would work for them. Then <br>
we can take a vote on the most popular!<br>
<br>
I'm getting so excited about this I don't know if I can wait 5 <br>
months....ahhhhhhhh. <br>

We are talking a Saturday, aren't we? In that case, August 18 or 25 would be our choice.<br>

So here is what we are thinking. We could do it July 28, any of the <br>
August Saturdays or the first two September Saturdays. If we do it <br>
between the 17th of August and the 3rd of September there is another <br>
attraction for out-of-towners to come. (The State Fair) But any of <br>
them would be fine. We will be going out of town one of the weekends <br>
but we haven't decided which and we could work it around what would <br>
be most convenient for everyone else. We are leaning towards having <br>
it at William Pond Park. That way it's on the bike trail and people <br>
could hide boxes in Goethe or William pond as they are just across <br>
the river from each other. William Pond has a covered picnic area <br>
that's why we are leaning towards it. Thoughts on the location would <br>
be greatly appreciated as would everyone's choices of dates. Maybe <br>
everyone could pick the top 2 dates that would work for them. Then <br>
we can take a vote on the most popular!<br>
<br>
I'm getting so excited about this I don't know if I can wait 5 <br>
months....ahhhhhhhh. <br>

Really just need to throw this out: Do we really want to think about a letterboxing gathering that could put us, realistically, in 100-105 degree heat? Considering those who reside the rest of the year in cool climes--Princess Lea, Lisa &amp; Robb, ArtTrekker, for example--and the best we could hope for is probably 95*, I think we should consider late September or even October?<br>

Okay, the only dates anyone has suggested is July 28, August 18 and <br>
August 25. I think I will take it over to the CA board on Atlas <br>
Quest now and see what intrest I get over there. If someone else has <br>
a date they would really prefer let me know ASAP.<br>

  Really just need to throw this out: Do we really want to think about a letterboxing gathering that could put us, realistically, in 100-105 degree heat? Considering those who reside the rest of the year in cool climes--Princess Lea, Lisa &amp; Robb, ArtTrekker, for example--and the best we could hope for is probably 95*, I think we should consider late September or even October?<br>
<br>
  Our 2 cents. . .<br>

  Okay, the only dates anyone has suggested is July 28, August 18 and <br>
  August 25. I think I will take it over to the CA board on Atlas <br>
  Quest now and see what intrest I get over there. If someone else has <br>
  a date they would really prefer let me know ASAP.<br>
