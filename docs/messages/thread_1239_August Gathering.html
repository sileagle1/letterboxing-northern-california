Lea makes a good point about trees and hiding spots, and especially the<br/>
longevity of boxes and being able to leave them somewhere.  I love the<br/>
idea of Shoreline Park, but maybe we should go with our original choice<br/>
this first time around, and revisit the idea of MHSP next time?  What say<br/>
you all?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa, is Redwood Regional still an acceptable option for you and Robb?  Is<br/>
it accessible enough?  I want our gathering to work out for everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Bump City is a great and original idea; I'd never heard of that term<br/>
before.  I was thinking that if we moved it back to Redwood Regional, we<br/>
could call it "Summer Breeze in the Trees"!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To clarify my comment about the Middle harbor Park being "wide <br/>
open," what I meant is that this type of park requires thinking like <br/>
a stealthy urban letterboxer, because there are fewer spots <br/>
forhiding big honkin' tupperware boxes.  I saw *lots* of great <br/>
hiding places.  In fact, I was delighted at the options.  I think <br/>
that teh Sacramento gathering offered the same sort of challenges, <br/>
albeit on a larger scale.<br/>
<br/>
BUT TO BE TOTALLY SELFISH....<br/>
<br/>
I have to cast my vote for the Middle Harbor Park.<br/>
<br/>
While the picnic site at Redwood is accessible, the rest of that <br/>
park isn't.  So that means that Robb would be stuck at the picnic <br/>
table during the entire gathering.  Not terribly interesting for him.<br/>
<br/>
The flat terrain and paved trails at Middle Harbor provide Robb the <br/>
ability to participate in this event, and not be left sitting on his <br/>
butt while we all run around.<br/>
<br/>
I really don't think the park will be too hot.  Quite the contrary.  <br/>
There was a stiff bay breeze blowing the day we were there.  I think <br/>
this could be cooler than the hills.<br/>
<br/>
This is, of course, just my preference.  <br/>

ps -- Lock Wench has offered a letterbox that relates to the Port of <br/>
Oakland.  If you know her work, this is a pretty big incentive!<br/>

any old time and if there is great concern, the event boxes can be <br/>
temporary and replaced in a safer place after the event (like the <br/>
one last year!)<br/>

access to some of the locals who have made the East Bay one of the <br/>
most creative, fun places to box in the Bay area--- <br/>

My vote:  Call it anything you want, but let's consider Redwood <br/>
Regional for another time and do Shoreline Park this year!!<br/>

redwoods and hiding places are not likely to be permanent, how about<br/>
turning it into something more like the Gabbering we had last summer<br/>
at Mimulus' and not hide any boxes, but turn it into a Traveling Stamp<br/>
Event.  Everyone could carve a traveling stamp or two and bring clues<br/>
or post clues in advance.  These stamps can be placed elsewhere, if<br/>
you choose, at a later date.  This way we will be able to stay<br/>
together as a group and spend more time getting acquainted and/or<br/>
visiting.<br/>

I think, since we are currently leaning towards MHSP, I would like to<br/>
encourage everyone (per Carole's suggestion) to create personal travelers<br/>
and cooties and stamps that can be exchanged in a group, AS WELL AS<br/>
encouraging those of you who are so inclined to plant.  I think it would<br/>
be nice to have lot of stamps to exhange amongst us but also have some<br/>
planted boxes to encourage interested folks to explore the park and<br/>
satisfy their 'boxing urges.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't heard any better name suggestions than something I tossed out<br/>
like "Summer Boxing by the Bay" - surely someone can do better than this?!<br/>

Hi all! Still up here in the PNW after the Stargazer's gathering (which was WONDERFUL BTW!) We've logged in our vote for venue and thought we'd chime in with an idea for the name. We could always just change the spelling to "Dawg Daze" or even "Dawg Daze by The Bay". It's nice to have something of an inspiration for carving ideas and a bunch of doggy stamps (not necessarily ALL, of course) would be adorable. (Think "Hog Heaven") "Breeze in the Trees" doesn't move us.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Oh--how about "Hot August Sights" or "Hot August Delights"?<br/>
<br/>
Whatever. We'll love anything you all decide.<br/>

As of today, 80% of votes are for the Shoreline Park, and 20% are for the<br/>
Redwood Regional Park. Please remember to vote!<br/>
<br/>
I think, since we are currently leaning towards MHSP, I would like to<br/>
encourage everyone (per Carole's suggestion) to create personal travelers<br/>
and cooties and stamps that can be exchanged in a group, AS WELL AS<br/>
encouraging those of you who are so inclined to plant. I think it would<br/>
be nice to have lot of stamps to exhange amongst us but also have some<br/>
planted boxes to encourage interested folks to explore the park and<br/>
satisfy their 'boxing urges.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't heard any better name suggestions than something I tossed out<br/>
like "Summer Boxing by the Bay" - surely someone can do better than this?!<br/>

August Saturdays or the first two September Saturdays. If we do it <br/>
between the 17th of August and the 3rd of September there is another <br/>
attraction for out-of-towners to come. (The State Fair) But any of <br/>
them would be fine. We will be going out of town one of the weekends <br/>
but we haven't decided which and we could work it around what would <br/>
be most convenient for everyone else. We are leaning towards having <br/>
it at William Pond Park. That way it's on the bike trail and people <br/>
could hide boxes in Goethe or William pond as they are just across <br/>

So here is what we are thinking. We could do it July 28, any of the <br/>
August Saturdays or the first two September Saturdays. If we do it <br/>
between the 17th of August and the 3rd of September there is another <br/>
attraction for out-of-towners to come. (The State Fair) But any of <br/>
them would be fine. We will be going out of town one of the weekends <br/>
but we haven't decided which and we could work it around what would <br/>
be most convenient for everyone else. We are leaning towards having <br/>
it at William Pond Park. That way it's on the bike trail and people <br/>
could hide boxes in Goethe or William pond as they are just across <br/>
the river from each other. William Pond has a covered picnic area <br/>
that's why we are leaning towards it. Thoughts on the location would <br/>
be greatly appreciated as would everyone's choices of dates. Maybe <br/>
everyone could pick the top 2 dates that would work for them. Then <br/>
we can take a vote on the most popular!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; thinks. We <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could also do it in September. We may not have it at Gibson <br/>
&gt; &gt; even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; though it's an awesome place we were discussing how many <br/>
&gt; &gt; places <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there would really be to hide boxes. We may go with Goethe <br/>
&gt; &gt; park <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; instead. If anyone has been to either what do you all think?<br/>

&gt; &gt; July<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be <br/>

&gt; having <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it at William Pond Park. That way it's on the bike trail and <br/>
&gt; people <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could hide boxes in Goethe or William pond as they are just <br/>

&gt; Maybe <br/>

Really just need to throw this out: Do we really want to think about a letterboxing gathering that could put us, realistically, in 100-105 degree heat? Considering those who reside the rest of the year in cool climes--Princess Lea, Lisa &amp; Robb, ArtTrekker, for example--and the best we could hope for is probably 95*, I think we should consider late September or even October?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We will be gone during most of August, but a gathering in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; July<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; awesome. We plan to be at the April 1st event, but only <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; short <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time in the afternoon.<br/>

  Okay, the only dates anyone has suggested is July 28, August 18 and <br/>
  August 25. I think I will take it over to the CA board on Atlas <br/>
  Quest now and see what intrest I get over there. If someone else has <br/>
  a date they would really prefer let me know ASAP.<br/>

  &gt; We like the idea of the July 28 date... Augusts in Sacramento are <br/>
  &gt; way hot... July can be a bit better. In any case as long as we are <br/>
  &gt; still living in Sacramento (or anywhere close) we will be there!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; If you need any help, let us know.<br/>

  &gt; The Gillespie Tribe<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; So here is what we are thinking. We could do it July 28, any <br/>
  of <br/>
  &gt; the <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; August Saturdays or the first two September Saturdays. If we <br/>
  do <br/>
  &gt; it <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; between the 17th of August and the 3rd of September there is <br/>
  &gt; &gt; another <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; attraction for out-of-towners to come. (The State Fair) But <br/>
  any <br/>
  &gt; of <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; them would be fine. We will be going out of town one of the <br/>
  &gt; &gt; weekends <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; but we haven't decided which and we could work it around what <br/>
  &gt; would <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; be most convenient for everyone else. We are leaning towards <br/>
  &gt; having <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; it at William Pond Park. That way it's on the bike trail and <br/>
  &gt; people <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; could hide boxes in Goethe or William pond as they are just <br/>
  &gt; across <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; the river from each other. William Pond has a covered picnic <br/>
  &gt; area <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; that's why we are leaning towards it. Thoughts on the location <br/>
  &gt; &gt; would <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; be greatly appreciated as would everyone's choices of dates. <br/>
  &gt; Maybe <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone could pick the top 2 dates that would work for them. <br/>
  &gt; Then <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; we can take a vote on the most popular!<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm getting so excited about this I don't know if I can wait 5 <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; months....ahhhhhhhh. <br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great, I'll come up with some dates and see what everyone<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks. We <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could also do it in September. We may not have it at Gibson <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; even<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though it's an awesome place we were discussing how many <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; places <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there would really be to hide boxes. We may go with Goethe <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; park <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead. If anyone has been to either what do you all think?<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We will be gone during most of August, but a gathering in <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; July<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; awesome. We plan to be at the April 1st event, but only <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; for a <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; short <br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time in the afternoon.<br/>

&gt; I agree that a gathering in late September or early October would<br/>
keep us out of the heat.  I conveniently like to forget just how hot<br/>
our summers are!<br/>

&gt;   Really just need to throw this out: Do we really want to think<br/>
about a letterboxing gathering that could put us, realistically, in<br/>
100-105 degree heat? Considering those who reside the rest of the year<br/>
in cool climes--Princess Lea, Lisa &amp; Robb, ArtTrekker, for<br/>
example--and the best we could hope for is probably 95*, I think we<br/>
should consider late September or even October?<br/>

&gt;   Okay, the only dates anyone has suggested is July 28, August 18 and <br/>
&gt;   August 25. I think I will take it over to the CA board on Atlas <br/>
&gt;   Quest now and see what intrest I get over there. If someone else has <br/>
&gt;   a date they would really prefer let me know ASAP.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; We like the idea of the July 28 date... Augusts in Sacramento are <br/>
&gt;   &gt; way hot... July can be a bit better. In any case as long as we are <br/>
&gt;   &gt; still living in Sacramento (or anywhere close) we will be there!<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; So here is what we are thinking. We could do it July 28, any <br/>
&gt;   of <br/>
&gt;   &gt; the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; August Saturdays or the first two September Saturdays. If we <br/>
&gt;   do <br/>
&gt;   &gt; it <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; between the 17th of August and the 3rd of September there is <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; another <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; attraction for out-of-towners to come. (The State Fair) But <br/>
&gt;   any <br/>
&gt;   &gt; of <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; them would be fine. We will be going out of town one of the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; weekends <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; but we haven't decided which and we could work it around what <br/>
&gt;   &gt; would <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; be most convenient for everyone else. We are leaning towards <br/>
&gt;   &gt; having <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; it at William Pond Park. That way it's on the bike trail and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; people <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; could hide boxes in Goethe or William pond as they are just <br/>
&gt;   &gt; across <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; the river from each other. William Pond has a covered picnic <br/>
&gt;   &gt; area <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; that's why we are leaning towards it. Thoughts on the location <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; would <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; be greatly appreciated as would everyone's choices of dates. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Maybe <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone could pick the top 2 dates that would work for them. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Then <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; we can take a vote on the most popular!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm getting so excited about this I don't know if I can wait 5 <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; months....ahhhhhhhh. <br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great, I'll come up with some dates and see what everyone<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks. We <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could also do it in September. We may not have it at Gibson <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; even<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though it's an awesome place we were discussing how many <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; places <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there would really be to hide boxes. We may go with Goethe <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; park <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead. If anyone has been to either what do you all think?<br/>
