                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife & I went to Napa for our 7th wedding anniversary & she went with<br>
me to find some boxes since I had to sit through her wine tasting.  We<br>
took a very nice (& strenuous) hike through the Westwood Hills Park to<br>
find the meadow box.  Got stung by a bee in the process & was a bit<br>
worried by the supicious oak looking stuff in the area, but got the<br>
stamp alright.  Was also worried about all the entries in the logbook<br>
about snakes in the box's hiding hole.  Didn't try for the 2nd box on<br>
the ridge since we ran out of time & the warnings about poison oak<br>
scared us off.  Also found the Napa-Not Wine box, stopped there between<br>
wineries.  The Meadow box's log book if full & the Napa-Not Wine book<br>
was damp & only had 1 page left after we stamped in.  I sent the<br>
planter, lisa (not lisascenic), an email, but I don't know if she lives<br>
in the area, so maybe a Napa or Sonoma local can replace the books.<br>
 <br>
Also, picked up Princess Lea's Angel Wine box (very pretty stamp,<br>
especially when done in multi-colors) & the Napa Valley Crusher by the<br>
Blue Rose Gang (ingenious container).  Both in good condition.  So now<br>
since Mimulus, Moon Rabbit & Wascally Wabbit have saturated Sonoma, they<br>
need to move over & start working on Napa.<br>

sounds like an interesting challenge!  Bummer.  Maybe<br>
I'll have to go wine tasting.<br>
