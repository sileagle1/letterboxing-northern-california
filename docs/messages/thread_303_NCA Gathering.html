by trail name and stamp only.  We would love to meet some of you, so I am<br>
all for offering my help in getting another Gathering together.. <br>
<br>
Since we have not been to one, I have no idea what it entails, but I am <br>
ready and willing.<br>
We work at H & R Block each year from 1st of January to April 15th.  It <br>
is a very "heads<br>
down, tails up and taxing" time.  Anytime after the 15th of April would <br>
be fine.<br>
<br>
My vote is for it to be held in the Sacramento/San Joaquin County area <br>
or Monterey would be fine.<br>
Please let me know how I can be of help.<br>

At the last gathering in Golden Gate Gathering or G3 I spoke with Doublesag, <br>
Old Blue, NancyAnne and Talkative Doug about having a gathering in Old Sac in <br>
the spring. It could also spill over into the capitol area. So I think we <br>
should talk about Late April or early May.. What do all of you think?<br>

Yeah, yeah, laugh all you want. Phonetically, Sagittarius (which is what the <br>
"saj" depicts) IS "SAJ" and it looks a lot better than "SAG" which is correct <br>
for the spelling. <br>
