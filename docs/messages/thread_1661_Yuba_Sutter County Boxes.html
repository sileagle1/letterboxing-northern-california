<br>
Wow, has it really been 3.5 years since we left NCA?<br>
<br>
Nice to see some talk about our old stompin grounds!<br>
<br>
As for Yuba/Sutter county boxes...<br>
<br>
Our Sutter Buttes box was/and is the first box in Sutter county. It <br>
has been there almost 5 years, and was recently found alive and well.<br>
<br>
Peter's Valentine and DS's Sutter Cemetary boxes are 2 more Sutter Co <br>
boxes that are long gone. I think Duck In the Park is still around. <br>
There was a family called the Salis Clan that planted about a half <br>
dozen boxes in and around YC and Marysville, tho I dont know if they <br>
still exist.<br>
<br>
We also had a box in Marysville (the Bok Kai - one of Mrs Jiggs' <br>
creations, and sadly only one finder (DS & OB) before the homeless got <br>
to it. I did find the box, baggies and parts of the log book tho, so <br>
all was not lost!<br>
<br>
Mrs Jiggs will be returning to Yuba City in Jun for about 10 days, so <br>
she will hopefully be able to finally do maintenance, change logs etc.<br>
<br>
BTW, we still have our Colusa County box kicking around here - think <br>
we might finally list it lol!<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
