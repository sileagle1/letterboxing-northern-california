                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, I see I must have been remiss about reading the dialy digest<br/>
becuase I completely missed the mini gathering for June.  I must of<br/>
thought it was the person visitng the week of spring break and i was<br/>
going to be out of town so did not pay attention. Anyway.  is<br/>
something still planned for Wednesday teh 7th?  That Starbucks is 3<br/>
miles from my house and if folks wanted to meet at my house that is<br/>
fine with me.  Or the starbucks is nice too.  <br/>
<br/>
Speakign of spring break we just got back from Death Valley.  The trip<br/>
was going to be more about camping than letterboxing, but in the midst<br/>
of getting food, gear, pets etc ready for departure i also printed out<br/>
some clues, then left my boxing stuff at home!  I realized that with a<br/>
sinking feeling somewhere around Stockton.  But Death Valley was<br/>
beautiful and the desert hot and dry which was the perfect anntidote<br/>
for all the rain we have here this spring.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I actually got out and did the Sugarloaf Gray Pine/Planet<br/>
Walk loop. The wildflowers loverly: shooting star, hounds tooth,<br/>
larkspur, camas, buttercups.  The ceanothus and mountain mahogany just<br/>
crazy with bloom and bees.  I also saw a bobcat up close.  I was not<br/>
able to check on the early planets...some kind of earth day picnic<br/>
going on  outside the observatory. I did check on<br/>
Sun...Lisa and Robbb the last visitors in November.  Mars was dry,<br/>
Saturn fine, alien explorer seems missing. And  It looks like Abamit<br/>
and her shadow may be gone too...the creek was up out of its banks<br/>
this winter.  I passed on Jupiter...couldnt remember where it was<br/>
exactly.  Neptune had been kicked out of its hiding place by a<br/>
squirell by the looks of all the acorns in the crevice and was wet. I<br/>
brought it home for maitainence.   I brough Pluto home to make<br/>
impressions for all the souls who got everything else except that one.<br/>
 I will be contacting you to arrange transfer. <br/>
<br/>
As for Gray Pine..box 6 was totally out in the open. I had gotten an<br/>
email from some geocachers who found it and nicely told me the trail<br/>
was open to hikers now, and closed everthign up tight, but then just<br/>
placed it at the base of the tree without hiding it.  Luckily with<br/>
all the bad weather since then I think very few people have been by<br/>
that way.  I brought it home because I need to give it a better<br/>
tupperware and a new hiding place if a geocache mearby the origianl<br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
Box 5 is intact, I was sort of zoning out and forgot about box 4 until<br/>
I was already downhill form it and did not go  back to check it, box 3<br/>
fine..but removed for maintence.  Adn boxes 1 and 2 are missing.  The<br/>
trial has been nicely fixed...the erosion had been pretty bad there <br/>
<br/>
But it was great to get back out on the trail again and see the<br/>
sights. I bough a CA Golden Poppy Park pass so I will be hittign th<br/>
trails at Jack London, etc, and checking on things.  I should replace<br/>
missing boxes before planting out new pones.  but who knows?  <br/>
<br/>
SOunds like the boxes at howarth and Spring lake parks need chcecking<br/>
if an east coast visitro is heading this way.  <br/>
<br/>
Greetigns to all and here is hoping for more decent weather.<br/>
