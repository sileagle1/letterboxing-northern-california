This is fabulous news!  My local video store doesn't have it, and <br>
neither do the two libraries near me.  I was plotting to join <br>
Netflix for the free trial period only, just to get my hands on a <br>
copy.  Mimulus must have great connections to get this on the air at <br>
such an appropriate time for us.  Well done!<br>

You will probably smack me for this, Don, but my first memory of <br>
seeing Clint Eastwood at the movie theaters was when I <br>
saw "Everywhich Way But Loose" and he was soooooo cuuuuuuute!  <br>
However, I don't think I can quite qualify as a whippersnapper <br>
anymore--I never did see The Care Bears Movie when it came out--I was <br>
much too old.<br>

  You will probably smack me for this, Don, but my first memory of <br>
  seeing Clint Eastwood at the movie theaters was when I <br>
  saw "Everywhich Way But Loose" and he was soooooo cuuuuuuute!  <br>
  However, I don't think I can quite qualify as a whippersnapper <br>
  anymore--I never did see The Care Bears Movie when it came out--I was <br>
  much too old.<br>

  Not no spring chicken, La Loka <br>

  just the time of the day, and that Magnificent7 was a porn movie. The <br>
  funny part is that no one mentioned my misspelling of Pilgrim, so <br>
  that reference was lost.<br>
