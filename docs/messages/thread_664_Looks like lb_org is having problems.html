Yeah, that was the same problem plaguing Atlas Quest most of the day<br/>
yesterday.  (Little bit of trivia: AQ and LbNA are now hosted with the<br/>
same company so chances are when something weird is happening on one,<br/>
there's a good chance that something weird will soon happen on the<br/>
other if it hasn't already.)<br/>
<br/>
I'll e-mail Choi the fix I used to get AQ working and hopefully he'll<br/>
get the problem fixed soon.<br/>

This reflects very poor Disaster Recovery planning. If something <br/>
happens to this company, all American letterboxing will be stopped <br/>
dead in its tracks! ;-)<br/>

Well, perhaps for a few days, but I do keep off-site backups of AQ<br/>
that I can ressurect with another hosting company if worse comes<br/>
worst.  I don't know what the LbNA policy is on backups, though, I'm<br/>
sure they do keep backups as well.<br/>
<br/>
It'll just have to go more "underground" and become more like<br/>
Dartmoor.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing!  =)<br/>
