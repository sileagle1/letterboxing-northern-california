                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past weekend, Robb and I checked up on a few of our <br/>
letterboxes.  So here's a little update:<br/>
<br/>
Robb replaced the Bay Trail Letterbox, which is part of the East Bay <br/>
Trail series in San Leandro.<br/>
<br/>
We also checked in on Icons for California: San Leandro.  Despite <br/>
suggestions that this letterbox had gone astray, I am happy to <br/>
report that it is safe and snug.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Kathy from Team Tysonosaurus sent me the following note <br/>
regarding the Floral Depot in Oakland:<br/>
<br/>
"...that stretch of sidewalk is completely fenced off right now due <br/>
to construction. It looks like the gate to which your letterbox is <br/>
stuck is just fine, but no one can get to it without climbing an 8 <br/>
foot chain link fence."<br/>
<br/>
Dem XX Men tell me that the sign that was holding the Macro Economics <br/>
letterbox in the Micro/Macro series in Fremont has been uprooted.  <br/>
They sent along photos, and I'm sorry to say that I think they're <br/>
correct.<br/>
