<br/>
Well, as I catch up on all the posts I feel a knot of<br/>
envy tightening in my tummy. I don't have the time<br/>
right now to do the traveling it takes to go boxing!<br/>
Boo hoo hoo!!!<br/>
<br/>
I had Thanksgiving day off and to myself, so I took<br/>
the dog and attempted to climb Mt. Tallac. Toucan<br/>
placed two boxes up there at the end of September and<br/>
I've been wanting to go after them ever since. The<br/>
trail was often like an icy luge run--good thing I had<br/>
my ski poles. Storms were threatening all around<br/>
(email me directly if you want a picture!) but it was<br/>
lovely hiking. Up, up, up through snow, then we<br/>
crested the big bowl and nearly got blown off the<br/>
mountain. We were up in the area of the first box, but<br/>
the clues were relative to the trail, which was hidden<br/>
under snow, and the storm was coming on quick. So I<br/>
had to give up and turn around. We were snowed on on<br/>
the way down, but it was so beautiful, I was very<br/>
grateful I live here. Even though it limits my<br/>
letterboxing opportunities! There's a temporary<br/>
drive-by box in it for you if you come visit!<br/>
<br/>
Re boxing alone: most of my boxing is done alone. I've<br/>
always gone hiking alone and been ok with it. I don't<br/>
know about the east bay so much. I have to admit that<br/>
I mostly go to places I know and am smart about<br/>
it--letting people know where I'm going, paying<br/>
attention to gut feelings. I don't want to be stopped<br/>
by not having companions--and often I just prefer my<br/>
solitude--but if you are overly nervous or scared, I<br/>
think that can make you a target. I think you have to<br/>
do what you are comfortable with (and be confident!).<br/>
<br/>
Oh--Blackbird--could you email me directions to the<br/>
school on the off-chance that I can make it to the<br/>
carving party? Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing, all you lucky stiffs!<br/>
