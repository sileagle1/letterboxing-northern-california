close.  I picked up 2 of Doublesaj's & Old Blue's Best of Davis boxes.<br>
They removed the other boxes just to get revenge on me for their<br>
difficulty in finding my MK74 box.  Also got Da Kool Kats' Bridal Veil<br>
Falls box, & artTrekker's SteamTrain & Placerville Pony Express (& again<br>
aT removed the Night Thieves to spite me).  That got me to 99 finds.  I<br>
also spent an hour getting soaked yesterday developing the clues &<br>
planting my 9th box.  That was the box I already had carved & ready to<br>
go, so now I just need to develop a new one & fine one more.<br>
