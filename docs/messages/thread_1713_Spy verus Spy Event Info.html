The GAME: SPY versus SPY<br/>
The Event Date: June 13 of 2009<br/>
Where: Reno, NV<br/>
<br/>
You, the Spy:<br/>
You are a spy. You steal. You lie. You cheat. You live in the <br/>
shadows. You sleep in "safe houses". You do all of this in the name <br/>
of the country that pays you the most. You are dishonorable. You have <br/>
no alliances. And you never know when you'll breathe your last <br/>
breath. <br/>
<br/>
Your Mission~ should you choose to accept: Obtain the necessary 5 <br/>
stamps on your playing paper. The Necessary Stamps are: Password, <br/>
Key, Code Book, Disguise and Passport. Then make it to your embassy <br/>
before you get "Caught" or hung as a "Traitor".<br/>
<br/>
First Team that makes it's to their embassy with the 5 stamp images, <br/>
before being caught or being hung as a traitor, WINS!<br/>
<br/>
How: These stamps will be hidden in "false" letter boxes intertwined <br/>
with real letterboxes. You will be given a list of 18 boxes. 14 of <br/>
these boxes will be "real" letterboxes. 4 boxes will be "false" <br/>
boxes. In these false boxes will be four of the needed stamps for <br/>
your playing paper. You must CHOOSE WISELY.<br/>
<br/>
5th Stamp? Good question. Glad you are paying attention. The 5th box <br/>
will be on the bastardly MOLE. He/She can be anyone . . . ANYONE <br/>
(maybe even you). To obtain the 5th stamp you must approach people, <br/>
giving them the "code word". If She/He is the mole, he will give you <br/>
the stamp. If She/he is not the mole, I am sure the blank look will <br/>
be obvious. <br/>
<br/>
Getting CAUGHT or being hung as a TRAITOR: Both of these are bad. <br/>
Very bad. No good spy would ever do both. However, somehow, someway, <br/>
the competition must be eliminated! Two randomly chosen people at the <br/>
start of the game will be given one stamp that reads "caught" and the <br/>
other a stamp that reads "traitor". <br/>
<br/>
Who ever has these stamps in their possession can approach you and <br/>
guess what country you are from. They will write down their guess on <br/>
your paper and sign their name. If they guess right, they stamp this <br/>
stamp on your playing paper and you are officially out of the game. <br/>
(However, please continue letterboxing, as this is a letterboxing <br/>
event, and you mostly definitely can still letterbox.) If he is <br/>
wrong, he gives you the stamp and you go your merrily spy ways. You <br/>
then take the stamp and approach someone else. You take your guess. <br/>
If you are right, they are out. If you are wrong, then you pass the <br/>
stamp on to them. And they take it someone else, who approaches <br/>
someone, and it goes on. <br/>
<br/>
On the playing paper, there will a spot for you to be asked TWICE <br/>
what country you are from. So, you have two chances of being knocked <br/>
out of the game by your competition. <br/>
<br/>
Country? You will be assigned a country. You will either spy for <br/>
America, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, or Spain. Never reveal your <br/>
country! That will get you caught or hung as a traitor.<br/>
<br/>
Teams: This is a friendly competition, but a competition no less. <br/>
Teams can be 1 person to 4 people. You must have a team name, a team <br/>
leader, and you must all wear "something" that makes you a team. Same <br/>
Yankee hat, same Nancy Drew pin, same T-shirt. Whatever, it's up to <br/>
you. Go Team Spirit! I would encourage teams who are less than 4 to <br/>
acquire others. That way, more people can participate. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are asking for donations of $10.00 from each team. We are asking <br/>
that all donations be sent in by April 1, 2009. We rented the spot <br/>
for this game. The donation will go towards this cost. <br/>
<br/>
Quick, Easy, Painless Rules:<br/>
No cheating! Cheaters will be "hung out to dry" and it won't be <br/>
pretty! <br/>
Don't remove Lbs or the stamps . . . that's just like cheating!<br/>
Teams stick together. No splitting, no dividing, no you go that way, <br/>
I'll go that way. United you play, united you fall!<br/>
And teams probably should not have anyone younger than 10, but that's <br/>
up to you. You don't want anyone holding up the team.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TIPS! To Insure Progress~SPIES!!!!!<br/>
Observe everything, presume nothing, trust no one . . . <br/>
A good spy knows details about real people like George Washington, <br/>
fictional people like Sherlock Holmes and their personal idols like <br/>
James Bond. A little research may get you a box or two. . . . .<br/>
Practice false occupations . . . You never know when a talent may be <br/>
called upon and you gotta sing it~ I mean wing it! <br/>
Don't take getting "Caught" or hung as a "traitor" personally. It's a <br/>
just a game. But you can continue looking for boxes just the same. <br/>
And there's always the potential of next year . . .<br/>
When it comes to the MOLE Discretion is key here! If you tip off <br/>
others that "so and so" is the mole, they will flock to the mole and <br/>
that needed stamp! <br/>
* Discretion! Discretion! Discretion!<br/>
<br/>
And the all Essential Potluck:<br/>
Every body will be ask to bring some. Please no arsenic! This a <br/>
friendly competition. (Will provide a list for items to bring later.)<br/>
