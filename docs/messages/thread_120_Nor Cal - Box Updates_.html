<br/>
Thought we'd post these updates on a bunch of boxes that 3/4 of Clan <br/>
Jiggs pickerd up on the 8th (Mom Jiggs is still recovering from her <br/>
latest bit of surgery (nothing major)).<br/>
<br/>
We started off in Redding, picking up Funhog's Riverside Rest Box - <br/>
it took some figuring out of the clues, but we finally figured it <br/>
out...tons of visitors, including Doublesaj and Ol Blue yesterday!<br/>
<br/>
Then...off to pick up Caitlin's Frog's Legs box! What a great little <br/>
park tucked away in the west end of Redding! The kids had a chance <br/>
to use the scooter and bike I had conveniently put in the trunk <br/>
(after all this time, I'm learning!!) Bythe way, we. saw that <br/>
Doublesaj and Old Blue were there..yesterday...(detecting a <br/>
pattern??)<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we travelled a little further west and picked up the Queen <br/>
City Shasta box, placed by dvn2r ckr! What a super little historic <br/>
park! The jail in the basement was great - though a little spooky <br/>
for my 5 y/o! Oh yesh, Doublesaj and Old Blue had visited..2 days <br/>
ago!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
soooo... for our finale we took a chance on Hwy 89 being open after <br/>
the winter, and went after the OUR MANY HATS series near Mt Lassen, <br/>
planted last year by the Retired Having Fun team!<br/>
<br/>
The hunch paid off as the Subway cave was open (as were the roads) <br/>
and we had the place to ourselves! The kids loved it so much that we <br/>
had to go through it twice!<br/>
<br/>
When we finally emerged, the sun had finally burnt through the <br/>
clouds, so off to the lookout to get the other 2 boxes and watch a <br/>
spectacular sunset behind Mt Lassen! We were first visitors of the <br/>
year for box 1 and 2. Fudrick had visited box 3 in march (but not 2 -<br/>
--go figure!<br/>
<br/>
Next week...something a little more genteel..and closer to home. <br/>
Davis and Auburn, anyone?<br/>
