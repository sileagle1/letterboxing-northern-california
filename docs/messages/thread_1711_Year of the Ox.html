series - Year of the Ox.  It won't appear in the list of new boxes on  <br>
AQ since it is piggy backed onto the old clue.  I still remember the  <br>
day six years ago when I was sitting around, chomping at the bit to  <br>
find a letterbox in my area (there were none to be found that I  <br>
hadn't already gotten) and decided, what the heck, I'll just take all  <br>
this LB energy and plant one myself.  It's been a challenge keeping  <br>
this series alive and well in an urban setting, but I have definitely  <br>
enjoyed adding to the series every year (it's good to have deadlines!)<br>
<br>
I am still thinking about the carving day I want to do this winter.   <br>
I am seeing Amanda on Thursday and we can pow wow about dates<br>
