town on the 18th, when it is the official Lunar New Year.  He (she?)<br>
turned out quite nicely.  Since this is an add-on to an existing<br>
series, it will not show up as a "new" listing on AQ or LbNA, so I<br>
figured I'd mention it here.<br>
<br>
Amanda and I made it out to Vacaville on Friday and boxed in the rain.<br>
 It wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't wiped out on a slippery<br>
slope and gotten covered from head to toe in mud.  I tried to "wash"<br>
it off with the wet asphalt, but of course that just left me soggy. <br>
We managed to protect our logbooks fairly well though, but an enormous<br>
drop did smear up my Baskervilles #3 stamp (which I think I may have<br>
stamped in sideways, so maybe it's better that way).  All told, we got<br>
18 finds, which ain't shabby.  We also got to meet up with DoubleSaj &<br>
Old Blue (who was playing hooky!) for lunch and a little postprandial<br>
boxing.  Good thing Amanda had a light lunch since she ended up<br>
squeezing through the gates for the Edwin Markham box!  We couldn't<br>
find any other way around.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who participated in that event - sorry I missed it.<br>
