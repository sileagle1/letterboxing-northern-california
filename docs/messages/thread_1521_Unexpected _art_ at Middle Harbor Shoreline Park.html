	We had a little picnic yesterday at Middle Harbor Shoreline<br/>
Park, and<br/>
	saw the *oddest* thing.<br/>
<br/>
	The park had erected life-sized photo-blowups of coyotes, which<br/>
we<br/>
	imagine are intended to scare away the Canada Geese. The coyotes<br/>
are<br/>
	in the area where they are making the sand beach. (Right near a<br/>
	letterbox of mine.)<br/>
<br/>
	At first, I thought I was looking at a particularly upset<br/>
schnauzer<br/>
	dog. But then I realized it was a photo, mounted on cardboard.<br/>
<br/>
