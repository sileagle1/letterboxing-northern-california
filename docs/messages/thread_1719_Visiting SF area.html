<br/>
We will be visiting the SF area, primarily for hiking &amp; letterboxing between JUL 18-26.  We prefer to do longer hikes and have done some preliminary research to see what is available.  Here are the areas that we have tentatively identified that probably have some good walks/hikes w/boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Cesar Chavez Park<br/>
Crown Beach Park<br/>
Garin Park<br/>
Huckleberry Botanic Preserve<br/>
Kennedy Grove Park<br/>
Rancho Laguna Park<br/>
Redwood Regional Park<br/>
Robert Sibley Volcanic Park<br/>
San Pedro Valley Park<br/>
Sawyer Camp Rec Trail<br/>
SF Bay Trail<br/>
Shoreline Park<br/>
Tilden Park<br/>
Wildcat Canyon Park<br/>
<br/>
We'd appreciate any feedback you might have on this list and/or recommendations for other areas we should consider.<br/>
<br/>
We'd also be interested in any local restaurant recommendations in these areas.<br/>
<br/>

We had a great gathering at Wildcat Canyon last year, and it should have<br/>
several good boxes to find there - there is a nice 6.5 mile loop if you like<br/>
long hikes.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, Huckleberry, Redwood and Sibley are all lovely places (they are<br/>
all in a row up there in the hills) with intact boxes. The boxes at Kennedy<br/>
Grove need maintenance - we had that gathering 6 years ago and many are<br/>

<br/>
We had a great gathering at Wildcat Canyon last year, and it should have<br/>
several good boxes to find there - there is a nice 6.5 mile loop if you like<br/>
long hikes.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, Huckleberry, Redwood and Sibley are all lovely places (they are<br/>
all in a row up there in the hills) with intact boxes. The boxes at Kennedy<br/>
Grove need maintenance - we had that gathering 6 years ago and many are<br/>
missing at this time.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in Oakland, Zachary's Pizza on College Ave (there's also one on<br/>
Solano in Berkeley) is a memorable stop.<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We will be visiting the SF area, primarily for hiking &amp; letterboxing<br/>
between JUL 18-26. We prefer to do longer hikes and have done some<br/>
preliminary research to see what is available. Here are the areas that we<br/>
have tentatively identified that probably have some good walks/hikes<br/>
w/boxes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cesar Chavez Park<br/>
&gt; Crown Beach Park<br/>
&gt; Garin Park<br/>
&gt; Huckleberry Botanic Preserve<br/>
&gt; Kennedy Grove Park<br/>
&gt; Rancho Laguna Park<br/>
&gt; Redwood Regional Park<br/>
&gt; Robert Sibley Volcanic Park<br/>
&gt; San Pedro Valley Park<br/>
&gt; Sawyer Camp Rec Trail<br/>
&gt; SF Bay Trail<br/>
&gt; Shoreline Park<br/>
&gt; Tilden Park<br/>
&gt; Wildcat Canyon Park<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We'd appreciate any feedback you might have on this list and/or<br/>
recommendations for other areas we should consider.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We'd also be interested in any local restaurant recommendations in these<br/>
areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
You are in my stomping grounds, so chances are you will find a box or two of mine!  I will respond about my boxes (see notes in capitals below).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you know offhand if any of these are missing?<br/>

&gt;       1.7 miles Survivor: the Amazon 4 Robert Sibley Volcanic Park POSSIBLY #4 MISSING - IT HAS BEEN "MISSING" BEFORE BUT WAS STILL THERE; I HAVE A REPLACEMENT STAMP FROM LAST TIME I WAS GOING TO REPLANT IT - MIGHT HAVE TIME TO CHECK IT BEFORE YOU COME<br/>
<br/>
&gt;       Contra Costa County<br/>
&gt;       2.3 miles Schoolhouse Rocks 2 Kennedy Grove Park PRETTY SURE ONLY 1 IS STILL VIABLE; NOT SURE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S BOXES THERE, BUT UNLIKELY THAT YOU WILL FIND MUCH&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other comments:<br/>
<br/>
 - I HIGHLY recommend Fish Ranch<br/>
 - I'm not sure if you can actually walk the Mermaid ones - I used my car :-)<br/>
 - Several of the Redwood/Sibley/Huckleberry boxes overlap<br/>
 - I might want to join you if you do Under the See - haven't gotten that series yet!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, we do consider that.  However we've been boxing for almost 6 years and<br/>
several times have found boxes that have been "attempted" by others.  We<br/>
also get a kick out of finding a box that hasn't been found in a long time.<br/>
On the other hand, if a box is KNOWN to be missing, then we will skip it.<br/>
We assume most planters update their clues accordingly to show status, but<br/>
know that some have become inactive in the hobby and may not be updating<br/>
their clues/status.<br/>

I would seriously look at the some of the last found dates, especially<br/>
Kennedy Grove since I believe some of them haven't been found for some time.<br/>
If time is limited, I would check ALL the last found dates so as to not wait<br/>
valuable time.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>

Here are the boxes that we have on our preliminary list (we always have more<br/>
