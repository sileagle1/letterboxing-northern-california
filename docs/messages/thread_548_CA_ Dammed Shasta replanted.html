Sometime last year the stamp in our Dammed Shasta Letterbox was <br/>
traded out for some trinkets by unknowing geoca$hers.  After a year, <br/>
we finally had the opportunity to travel the 500+ miles to add a new <br/>
stamp and change out the logbook.  Never in my wildest dreams did I <br/>
think I'd actually make money letterboxing--but in lieu of the stamp <br/>
this particular letterbox made me $0.50 and a couple of beautiful <br/>
polished glass nuggets.  ;)  Still not sure how they crammed so much <br/>
stuff in this tiny, microletterbox?<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, it's in the path of geoca$hers; so, we've found a new, <br/>
more distant home for it.  Please ensure you have the new clues <br/>
before you head out for this one.  It's basically a drive-by on I-5 <br/>
(with a 10 mile roundtrip detour).<br/>
