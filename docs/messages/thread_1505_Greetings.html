Municipal Park, it is my duty to inform you all that you are mocking<br/>
not only our pigmentation (or lack thereof), but also our way of life.<br/>
 For shame.  While we may choose to live in the recesses of this<br/>
wonderful park instead of houses or apartments, we are not inhuman. <br/>
We do not chase cars.  We do not eat poodles.  From time to time we do<br/>
visit the log cabin, but only to check that the local hooligans have<br/>
not defaced it again.  We are to understand that you will be having a<br/>
gathering for your hobby in our park this Sunday.  We look forward to<br/>
meeting with you in person to iron out this misunderstanding.  We are<br/>
sure that both your group and our group will be able to proceed in<br/>
mutual respect and honor.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
A.H.<br/>
