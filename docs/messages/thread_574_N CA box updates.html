Okay, I don't know where the 'official' division between Northern & <br>
Southern CA 'really' is and when I asked folks along the way (i.e. <br>
near Bakersfield) nobody could give me a definitive answer so if I <br>
accidentally post info about Southern CA boxes in this venue, please <br>
pardon my ignorance--it wasn't intentional.  ;)  I have this <br>
internal notion that the 'border' is somewhere around SLO and across?<br>

Chorazin's Life (only attempted the first one--no luck but found <br>
evidence of a crime and called the police instead so didn't pursue <br>
any others in the area)  In fact, it looks like GGP is going through <br>
a major Spring Clean Up at the moment coinciding with the renovation <br>
of some of the venues, so I wonder if this may be part of the reason <br>
some of the boxes were invisible?  The ones we did find in this <br>
area, we tried to camouflage exceptionally well--hoping to preclude <br>
non-letterboxers from finding them.<br>
<br>
So, that's a quick run-down of our 'blur' trip through Northern CA.  <br>
I'll attempt to contact the individual planters of these letterboxes <br>
over the next few days as time allows.  We had these grandiose plans <br>
of driving up along the ENTIRE California Coast to revisit my old <br>
stomping grounds but we simply ran out of time (why does Feb only <br>
have 28 days???) once we hit Marin County and had to hightail it <br>
back home along I-5, yet again!  Work is such a drag...  :(<br>
<br>
For all the planters of the aforementioned awesome letterboxes, <br>
thanks for an unforgettable vacation throughout California!!!  Wow--<br>
I'm still in total awe of the number of boxes that now exist <br>
throughout the state--it gave us a dilemma we'd never before <br>
experienced (apart from the Northeastern US and Portland, <br>
OR/Vancouver, WA)--we had to pick & choose between letterboxes and <br>
it was REALLY difficult to do!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

SLO County would be part of "Central California", so it doesn't really<br>
fit well in either category.  It tends to end up in both as a result.  =)<br>
<br>
I'm just so bummed I couldn't be in SLO when you passed through!  I<br>
like showing off my hometown to friends who aren't from there.  Oh,<br>
well....  Maybe next time!<br>

<br>
I think we had this discussion when the groups were just starting up - <br>
naturally there was some competition to secure SLO for the North vs. <br>
the South.  In my selective memory, I thought that we decided SLO <br>
should be in Northern California as far as the mailing lists go for <br>
population reasons (3/4 of the state's population already being in <br>
"true" Southern CA).  But Ryan's right, SLO is actually Central CA <br>
(Kernville too, isn't it?), so maybe it's best to just post to both <br>
groups.<br>

These are all mine and I thank you for letting me know their status.  <br>
Playland is actually probably still there - I get lots of reports it is <br>
missing but every time I check it is still right where I left it.  I'm <br>
not sure where folks are being led astray - maybe it's the part about <br>
the burnt log, since it's just a dinky thing about 12" long, not a big <br>
LOG log.<br>

<br>
I found this one one the day of the gathering and then tried to take <br>
Amanda back to it later - knowing exactly where it was, I can confirm <br>
that it was indeed gone!<br>

<br>
Finally got a moment (around work commitments) to explain this in <br>
more detail.  Well, the police incident had nothing to do with the <br>
drug parapharnelia we came across earlier in the day looking for a <br>
letterbox near Presidio.  Instead, we were exploring the environs of <br>
Chorazin's prayer book and noticed lots of personal belongings <br>
showing up in odd places around the area.  First, it was an <br>
expensive looking pair of DKNY sunglasses in a case, then it was a <br>
credit card receipt, then lipstick, then AAA card, then checkbook, <br>
then purse, then cell phone, diapers, baby wipes and it went on and <br>
on.  Having had my car broken into while on a trail in Tacoma a <br>
couple of summers ago, I figured this lady felt as similarly <br>
violated as did I at the time and thought that she'd be comforted a <br>
little in actually seeing her belongings again (something that never <br>
happened in my case).  <br>
<br>
So, I attempted to gather all of the belongings up from around the <br>
region and was trying to figure out how to return her things to <br>
her.  The whole time I feared actually finding 'body parts' in the <br>
area and prayed and prayed that this wouldn't be the case (yes, both <br>
my in-laws are retired court reporters from the Alameda County Court <br>
System, with experience in mostly death penalty cases AND I get a <br>
daily run-down of what crimes have been committed around the Bay <br>
Area and why I shouldn't hike out and about alone with the kids and <br>
no firearm!)--so, I'd sort of been 'primed' to expect the worst <br>
scenario around there.  <br>
<br>
I did find an insurance card and car registration inside so it <br>
wouldn't have been too difficult to track her down.  Also, I found <br>
evidence that she was from a military family of some sort--so that <br>
usually makes locating somebody a bit easier (at least, for me in my <br>
particular circle).  So, I was just putting together my mental plan <br>
of how to return her things to her when I saw a police squad car <br>
pass by--I flagged him down, transferred the items to him, he opened <br>
up a police case on the found property and we went on our merry <br>
way!  So, that was our 'civic duty' good deed for the day!  <br>
Thankfully, it didn't involve finding body parts strewn about--which <br>
is really what I was expecting at the time!!!  <br>
