anniversary. When I founded it 3 years ago, it only had 10 members, <br/>
and our own lisascenic joined shortly afterwards. <br/>
<br/>
Now it has grown to a whopping 130 members! The area where my family <br/>
lives (Oneida County in central NY) didn't have any boxes until I <br/>
planted the first five. Today, there are so many boxes that I was <br/>
astounded. I just planted 2 more in Utica, NY while visiting my family.<br/>
<br/>
The group now runs very smoothly without my being a moderator. Please <br/>
join me in congratulating LbNY. If you know any new or potential Lbers <br/>
in NY state, please let them know about the group. <br/>

Is there no end to your talents? If everyone took to letterboxing as you have with your fine carvings and stimulating clues, the whole planet would be filled with wonderous 'boxes. <br/>
<br/>
The NY gang is as lucky to have you as we left-coasters are!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Paul!<br/>

I have 3 Cabinet of Curiosities boxes planned, and could do more. All <br/>
3 stamps are done, and need unusual containers and logbooks for 2 of <br/>
the others. Box #1 has a tapestry fabric roll (handmade polymer clay <br/>
button fastener) as a container, a handmade matchbook-stylelogbook, <br/>
and a collection catalogue card with illustration and acquisition <br/>
number. <br/>
<br/>
While in NY last week, I found both a letterbox and an authentic <br/>
period curiosity cabinet at a historical society in a Gothic Revival <br/>
cottage from the late 1800s. It's in the town of Oneida, NY, which has <br/>
now been dotted with about 30 letterboxes. My nephews and niece &amp; I <br/>
did 2 afternoons of boxing there.<br/>
<br/>
I also dug out a few boxes that I worked on in the past 2 years that <br/>
never got completed. They mostly need clues and a planting spot. I <br/>
have a Harvey Milk box that's ready to go, and 3 others.<br/>
<br/>
I've been focusing on my artwork (pastels &amp; acrylic paintings), and <br/>
feel like I've improved a lot. (Examples posted on my nlog: <br/>

<br/>
Why in the world would you be feeling disconnected from us when we've all been waiting with baited breath to hear from you or see a new 'box from the Talented Paul in SF? Honestly, I've seen many posts wondering of your whereabouts, some going through virtual withdrawls for another 'box of yours, ourselves included.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if you will if (heaven forbid) Lisascenic and Robb were to take, say, a one year hiatus? No blog, no new 'boxes, not a sighting of the recumbant bike or beautiful curly hair? That's about how it is without you actively letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Paul, we LOVE you AND your 'boxes! There's a dark hole when you're elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, glad you're back and ready to plant. Good luck with the GOV'T. . .<br/>
<br/>
Big Hugs,<br/>
