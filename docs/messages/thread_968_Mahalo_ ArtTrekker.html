letterbox today.  As always, her work is an inspiration, and a delight<br>
for the eyes.<br>
<br>
What a day!  We took a boat to the Forbidden Island of ni'ihau for<br>
snorkelling.  We swam with a monk seal, which is the second-most<br>
endangered seal in the world.  The snorkelling was amazing, as was the<br>
boat ride, which took us by the Na Pali coast.  We say manta rays, a<br>
leatherback turtle, spinner dolphins (the first one we saw even did<br>
the spinning leap for which they are named), bottle nosed dolphins,<br>
and Robb spotted that boat's first migrating humpback whale of the<br>
season.  <br>
<br>
Poor guy.  He grew up boating, and had his first bout of seasickness<br>
today.  He spent a lot of time staring at the horizon, which is how he<br>
spotted that whale.<br>
<br>
Since we hadn't snorkelled enough, we went to another beach where a<br>
monk seal had just hauled out that morning.  I spoke with the woman<br>
from the state of Hawaii, who was setting the barricades around this<br>
seal, and learned a lot more about these fascinating cratures.<br>

<br>
And, if you happen to go to Kauai any time soon, you might just look<br>
for my letterboxes about some of the creatures I've been seeing.<br>
<br>
But the room feels like we're still on the boat, so I'll write the<br>
clues another day....<br>
