<br>
Since your Folsom P-house stamp was my second and Old Blue's first box ever <br>
back in June of 2002, and since we live only about 40 miles from said box, I <br>
think it only fitting we be the ones to replace the stamp once you recarve it. <br>
Need our address or do you have it?<br>

I have a stamp ready and waiting to find its way into this letterbox.<br>
I only need a mailing address to make it a reality. If you would<br>
contact me offline, I'd love to get this little baby into the mail to<br>
you. Thanks so much for offering to help! Funhog<br>
