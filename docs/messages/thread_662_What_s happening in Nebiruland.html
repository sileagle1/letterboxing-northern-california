Hello, all!<br/>
<br/>
It's sure been a busy eight months. Not only because of the new baby -<br/>
we moved from Sacramento to Petaluma in February. So not too much time<br/>
for our favorite hobby ever. This past couple weekends we did manage to<br/>
pick up a couple of nice drive-bys, though. Say Cheese! at the Marin<br/>
French Cheese Factory, and Lachryma Montis (plus our first hitchhiker in<br/>
ages, the Golden Goose) in beautiful Sonoma. We found the Lachryma<br/>
Montis bag unzipped, and things a bit damp inside the box, but luckily<br/>
we had lots of paper towel and an extra Ziploc with us and were able to<br/>
put things mostly to right.  <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;<marincheese.jpg>&gt;  &lt;<lachryma.jpg>&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We're so happy to see all the current and pending Petaluma boxes, and<br/>
will be picking those up over the spring and summer. Hopefully we'll be<br/>
back to snagging the more ambitious stuff, too, when we finally get a<br/>
decent backpack carrier for the bub (any suggestions would be<br/>
appreciated). And at least *one* plant would be nice, too - thinking<br/>
Sonoma could use it.<br/>
<br/>
Very regretfully, we won't be attending GRR. The baby still loathes the<br/>
car, and a 1.5 hour drive just isn't the best idea. I've an Old Sac<br/>
stamp that I carved ages ago and never got around to planting... Would<br/>
someone care to find a home for it before the gathering? I'll scan it<br/>
and send you the image if you'd like - it's not too shabby, if I do say<br/>
so myself :-) I can have it mailed out to any taker this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing,<br/>
Jennie (and Darin and Daniel)<br/>

That is quite the coincidence. What's the probability we'd pick it up so<br/>
soon, when we've only got two boxes out there?<br/>
<br/>
That'd be super! Email me offlist with your addy. Thanks :-D<br/>

Yes, that's the one we found here first. May pick up the other downtown box this weekend, plus one or two more. Small town, probably bump into each other at some point (if we haven't already and didn't realize it).<br/>

Welcome to Petaluma!  I have just arrived back from an unexpected trip<br/>
to New Mexico. Have just planted the Sweet Dreams Series today.  As<br/>
Wascally said, it's a bit of a hotbed here in Petaluma right now. <br/>
There's another new Petaluma, Bag Lady, who seems like she might be<br/>
interested in planted a couple, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry we won't meet you at the GGR.  Perhaps a local event?<br/>

&gt; We're so happy to see all the current and pending Petaluma boxes, and<br/>
&gt; will be picking those up over the spring and summer. Hopefully we'll be<br/>
&gt; back to snagging the more ambitious stuff, too, when we finally get a<br/>
&gt; decent backpack carrier for the bub (any suggestions would be<br/>
&gt; appreciated). And at least *one* plant would beWelWe nice, too -<br/>
thinking<br/>
&gt; Sonoma could use it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Very regretfully, we won't be attending GRR. The baby still loathes the<br/>
&gt; car, and a 1.5 hour drive just isn't the best idea. I've an Old Sac<br/>
&gt; stamp that I carved ages ago and never got around to planting... Would<br/>
&gt; someone care to find a home for it before the gathering? I'll scan it<br/>
&gt; and send you the image if you'd like - it's not too shabby, if I do say<br/>
&gt; so myself :-) I can have it mailed out to any taker this weekend.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Boxing,<br/>
&gt; Jennie (and Darin and Daniel)<br/>
