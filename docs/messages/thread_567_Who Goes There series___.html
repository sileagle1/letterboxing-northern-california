I checked out a bit of the series last week.  Boxes 1 and 2 were <br/>
reported missing.  Box 1 is there, but box 2 got munched.  I found <br/>
a bit of it and the rock that was covering it away from the hiding <br/>
spot.  I will replace the missing box soon, maybe next <br/>
weekend...as far as I know the rest are still in place.<br/>
