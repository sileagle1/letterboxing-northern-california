one day. This weekend we increased our P count by 6 and all along the<br>
northern California coast between Fort Bragg and Mendocino where Lbs <br>
are decidedly scarse!! The clues will posted later today so watch for <br>
them. And plan a trip to retrieve them ASAP so you can get the jump <br>
on the Jiggs Family who, in our humble opinion, need to work on their <br>
P count a little harder!! There are rewards for those lucky first <br>
finders!!<br>
