now I <br>

the PAcific Coast series planted by Old Blue and Doublesaj last August <br>
between Squaw valley and Sugar Bowl.  <br>
<br>
Ahhh, Mim! Old Blue did that one all by his lonesome! While I'm attempting to <br>
get in shape (and doing a darned fine job of it for an old lady if I do say <br>
so myself) that hike was WAY to rigorous for me! YOU, though, will certainly be <br>
able to do it with a little lifting of the altitude barriers.<br>
