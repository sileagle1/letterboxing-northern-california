a similar one for this new quake.  I don't know if the epicenter is <br>
located on publicly accessible land, but even if it's not, I figure I <br>
can still hide an earthquake themed box in Paso or San Simeon.  <br>
Anyhow, where does one find information such as the stuff found in <br>
the Loma Prieta box like 911 transcript calls?  Or even the exact <br>
coordinates where the epicenter was?  (Granted, at least the guy that <br>
hid the Loma Prieta box had a big old sign to tell him the correct <br>
spot!)<br>
<br>
Anyhow....  just thoughts rambling around in the back of my head.  =)<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to feel some good, solid aftershocks when I visit my <br>
grandma's place in Paso Robles for Christmas tomorrow!  =)<br>

They list the location as 35.706 N, 121.102 W<br>
<br>
There's a nifty feature on the site that allows you to report if you felt the earthquake <br>
or what you felt if you were near the epicenter.<br>
