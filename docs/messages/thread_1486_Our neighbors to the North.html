                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, Robb and I just got back from the Pacific Northwest, which we as<br>
West-Coast Newbies, had never visited.  Boy do those letterboxers know<br>
how to throw an event!  I've never seen so many personal travelers and<br>
cooties in my life.  (I think I reached cootie saturation<br>
point...didn't get to finish my beer, or dinner, because of all the<br>
cooties I was dealing with.  I think I may have to pass on the cooties<br>
and travelers in the future.)<br>
<br>
There was some superb carving.  Redundant Platypus' cooties, which<br>
were the size and shape of guitar picks and had portraits of the<br>
members fo Green Day.....amazing.<br>
<br>
Or how about Maiden's scent-based clues?  She brought whole new<br>
meaning to the phrase "this letterbox stinks!"<br>
<br>
But I'll tell you, it was a bit weird, walking into a room of<br>
strangers, and being known to so many people via our blog.  Very odd,<br>
indeed.<br>
<br>
And speaking of which, I will eventually find the energy to sort<br>
through my photos and write about all this on the blog....<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing you all on April Fool's Day!<br>

Don't worry...Robb and I won't be spreading (many) cooties.  While I<br>
found some of them cute, I quickly reached the "oh please, not another<br>
thing I have to stamp in the logbook" stage.  Somehow, letterboxing<br>
became more like a onerous task than like pure fun.  Also, I think<br>
that this many stamps rather diminished the luster of the really<br>
special images that a lot of thought and care went into.<br>
<br>
I'm not anti-cootie, but there is such a thing as too much.<br>

ps -- of course, we haven't fully unpacked from our trip.   Who knows<br>
how many of these things we'll find, yet!<br>
