Thanks to the fish out of water posting, I checked out the clues for <br/>
the Daly City box....how fun and clever of Tara!  I would love to hear <br/>
other folks favorite boxes....just the name...so I can go read the <br/>
clues and do some armchair letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
So far my faves have been Vertigo #1 (even though the box was MIA..it <br/>
was still fun solving the clues!) and Nepenthe.  My favorite Stamp is <br/>
Box #1 Oakland Art Museum.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, new box in Sonoma County...Pomo Hummingbird.<br/>
<br/>

Pssst - please be careful when revealing mystery locations!  It should <br/>
be referred to as the Museum of Modern Art series -  anyone who hasn't <br/>
been to this series yet, pretend you didn't see this.<br/>
<br/>
As far as my favorite found boxes in Northern California, I'd say the <br/>
Mineral Baths at Alum Rock Park is my favorite stamp (is it missing <br/>
again?) and as far as clues go, I've had a lot of fun with Sir <br/>
Balthazar's Middle Earth series.  Now, of course I have yet to get the <br/>
Lemony Snicket box in Auburn, which I am sure will take precedence in <br/>
both these categories once I actually find it.<br/>

Yes, we think it WILL, Lea. It is, by far, our favorite for clue difficulty, <br/>
stamp AND amazing log book. <br/>
<br/>
Buzzard's "Suicide Bridge" in the Halloween Series is another favorite as is <br/>
Ryan's "Los Osos Oaks" series. The place these boxes are planted is positively <br/>
magic! Certainly the elves, fairies and other creatures of the oaks are all <br/>
about that place this time of year! And "Playland Lives" by Princess Lea is the <br/>
greatest stamp, especially for those of us who grew up going to this part of <br/>
S.F.<br/>

Our favorite California letterbox, so far, has to be Wino Country by <br/>
Mimulus.  The clues, the location, and the stamp are all <br/>
entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
We have just begun to explore all the letterboxes in California, so <br/>
we undoubtedly have a lot of great adventures ahead!<br/>

I have to second the Museum of Modern Art series...box #1 is also my favorite carving of all times.  Though I also love the Anatomy Quiz stamp, but that is for purely sentimental reasons.  As far as hikes go,  I feel like I really earned the Boxer Family Series stamps!<br/>

There are so many! But I will narrow it down to California!<br/>
<br/>
Catching some Sun in the Quad by Don and Gwen, Long Beach, CA,<br/>
November 12, 2001 was my first California Letterbox, so that has a<br/>
special place in my heart.<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy Funhog's Ide Adobe Letterbox in Red Bluff, CA. It is a<br/>
real challenging box to find and rehide discreetly. <br/>
<br/>
Marina Pacifica Plumbing Problem in Long Beach, CA has one of the most<br/>
unique hiding places that I have seen created by the letterboxer. And<br/>
it is a gorgeous hand-carved stamp too!<br/>
<br/>
Way Cool Letterbox in Big Sur, CA is another gorgeous stamp that is in<br/>
a gorgeous place.<br/>
<br/>
Tsunami, Big Wave Letterbox in Crescent City, CA is yet another<br/>
gorgeous stamp in a gorgeous place! They just go on and on and on...<br/>
