&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As it turns out i still haven't had much time to think about this, but I<br/>
&gt; thought I'd get some ideas out before too much more time went by.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It looks to me like the main questions right now are:<br/>
&gt; - location<br/>
&gt; - date<br/>
&gt; - activities (?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm all for taking this gathering somewhere new that isn't necessarily San<br/>
&gt; Francisco-centric.  I'm definitely in favor of taking it somewhere that<br/>
&gt; allows the maximum number of people to participate, factoring in distance,<br/>
&gt; weather, and ease of use for all interested participants.  To that end,<br/>
&gt; I'd suggest that Lisa's suggestion of the Redwood Regional Park in Oakland<br/>
&gt; looks like it fits the bill, with lots of hiking trails, picnic tables<br/>
&gt; with disabled-accessible areas, closer than SF (and no SF traffic!) for<br/>
&gt; folks outside the Bay Area, but still in the BA so likely to be warm but<br/>
&gt; not too warm.  We can reserve a picnic area if we choose, so we could<br/>
&gt; start or top the day off with a potluck or picnic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If this doesn't appeal to anyone, other suggestions are welcome!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As far as the date goes, I'd personally lean towards the end of August,<br/>
&gt; mainly because I'll be away in early August and would like to at least<br/>
&gt; have a weekend back in town before the gathering to finish preparations on<br/>
&gt; any boxes I might make and actually go plant them. I am of course open to<br/>
&gt; other dates - end of July or early September even, but end of August, the<br/>
&gt; 26th or 27th, seems like a good target to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Considering activities, of course I assume folks will want to plant boxes<br/>
&gt; and spend much of the time looking for boxes.  It being summer and the<br/>
&gt; season of barbeques, would there be any interest in a potluck, picnic, or<br/>
&gt; barbeque of some kind?  It would be a nice way to cap off a day and set<br/>
&gt; some time aside for stamp exchanges.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know many of you have coordinated events in the past, so I urge you to<br/>
&gt; please make suggestions, speak up, and generally let me know of your ideas<br/>
&gt; and tips.  I'm perfectly happy to co-coordinate with anyone who wants to<br/>
&gt; pitch in... I mainly wanted to get the ball rolling and help this happen.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking forward to hearing from you all -<br/>

&gt; I am up for a meet and greet in Santa ROsa on June 7th. I also wanted<br/>
&gt; to say I pulled the Howarth PArk boxes due to all the illicit/homeless<br/>
&gt; activity that seems to take place in that area of the park. Every time<br/>
&gt; I would go to check on those boxes I would find broken liquor bottles<br/>
&gt; homeless encampments, and last time porn magazines.  Eeew! Definitley<br/>
&gt; not a scene I would want letterboxers (esp with kids) to happen on.<br/>

&gt; Did you see the post about an east coast 'boxer here the end of July?<br/>
&gt; it would be nice to include her and for us, Sunday, July 30th would be<br/>
&gt; wonderful. We think Redwood Regional would be great and it's always<br/>
&gt; nice to have people bring "something to share" food-wise. Wheather we<br/>
&gt; have a BBQ main 'dish' or not depends on finding a person who's willing<br/>
&gt; to 'man' the grill for a couple of hours minimum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I encourage everyone to put in for a date we can all vote on so a<br/>
&gt; picnic site can be reserved (very important and the shadier the<br/>
&gt; better!) Ours is Sunday, July 30.<br/>

&gt; Saw your previous email about this.. July is just not going to be a good<br/>
&gt; time for a gathering for me, personally.  I could do dinner, but I'll be<br/>
&gt; out of town part of July and again in early August and I just don't have<br/>
&gt; the resources during this time that I'd want to organize a gathering,<br/>
&gt; prepare a box, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My vote stays with end of August - but that's just my vote. :)  If the<br/>
&gt; majority votes for July, that's fine, but I may have to scale back on<br/>
&gt; organization if that's the case.  I want to be able to help as best I can,<br/>
&gt; but don't want to overcommit myself.<br/>

&gt; We will be traveling from mid July through the first week of August.<br/>
&gt; For selfish reasons only, we would prefer that the date for the<br/>
&gt; gathering is the latter part of August.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It's been so long since we've been boxing that we'd sure hate to miss<br/>
&gt; an event like this.<br/>
