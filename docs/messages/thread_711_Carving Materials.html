I have done some boxing in Vermont where it can get down to 35 below <br/>
zero.  I was AMAZED at how well the stamps held up, and even the <br/>
crummy GladWare containers were okay.  Last summer I found some <br/>
stamps that had been hidden in 1998 and they were as good as new.  <br/>
Problems arise more from infiltrating water than the cold - in fact, <br/>
I'd say the cold may even preserve the box!  The Speedy Stamp is the <br/>
pink stuff, right?  That stuff is indestructible.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How funny!  I posted this question on the NewBoxers Forum, and was <br/>
told that the Steedy Stamp (pink) was worthless.  I really like this <br/>
material. Beautiful crispness of detail, and seemingly very tough.  <br/>
The white material (not Staedler Mars) is heartbreakingly awful.  <br/>
Look at it too hard, and it dents and chips.  Oh well, live and <br/>
learn....<br/>
<br/>
Did the Vermont boxes have a stamp pad or pen in them?  I get the <br/>
impression that East Coast 'boxers include this, but it seems like a <br/>
great way to ruin a log book over time.<br/>

Sometimes people get Speedy Stamp and Speedy Cut mixed up since<br/>
they're both from Speedball.  The Speedy Stamp ("the pink stuff") is<br/>
generally highly thought of by most people while nobody likes the<br/>
Speedy Cut ("the OTHER white stuff") because it falls apart too<br/>
easily. The only good thing I can say about Speedy Cut is that at<br/>
least you can practice with it cheaper than Speedy Stamp, but you<br/>
definitely don't want to use Speedy Cut for anything other than<br/>
practicing a new technique!<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the person on the NewBoxers forum probably got the two<br/>
confused and meant to say that the Speedy Cut was worthless, which is<br/>
certainly true!<br/>
<br/>
As for the difference between Speedy Stamp and MasterCarve (i.e.<br/>
Staedler Mars), it largely is a matter of personal preference. They<br/>
both hold up very well in the elements, but everyone has their<br/>
favorites. *shrug* I just LOVE the way MasterCarve smells, myself. =)<br/>
But I usually use Speedy Stamp just because it's thinner (and can<br/>
therefore fit into smaller boxes) and it's cheaper. But that's just a<br/>
personal preference. I'm happy to use either.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
