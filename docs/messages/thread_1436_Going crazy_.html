do some carving but no stuff. Drat!<br/>

Michaels recently changed the way they did a bunch of stuff. They no longer sell "the pink stuff" separately, only in a set with a carving tool and attachments for about $11. Even if you use the 40% off coupon they have in the Sunday paper every other week, it's not cheap. (They don't carry the magazines I used to use my coupon on either!) YOu can find great little books to put in your boxes most of the time though in those bins where everything's $1 or 2 for $1.<br/>
<br/>
Nils is right about University Art. They have a great supply of most everything you need. The really thick white stuff is the very best carving medium and they have it in several sizes with great log books too. Not cheap but quality.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

seem to have the stuff in the same places and the employees at my <br/>

first stamps were carved on them) which can be found almost anywhere<br/>
(7-11? Certainly Longs and Walgreens), and even better, the white<br/>
version af basic vinyl erasers sold in a 3-pack at Staples. In my<br/>
second month of Lbing, I went on the road and had wanted to carve<br/>
a hitchhiker, but had forgotten my carving stuff. I found Pink Pearls<br/>
in a little drugstore in a tiny, woebegotten town, and the hardware<br/>
store had a funny little keychain boxcutter tool that I used to carve.<br/>
<br/>
Funhog gets her supplies from a store near her in Portland, and I went<br/>
there when I was passing through. I was pretty impressed with their<br/>
prices. I can't remember the name of the place, or if they do mail<br/>
order, but you could contact Funhog and ask her.<br/>

Have fun carving! aT<br/>
