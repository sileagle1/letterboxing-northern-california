                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know I haven't been out boxing much this spring, but now I may have<br/>
the perfect opportunity, if I can find the right boxes.  My wife is<br/>
going out of town for 5 days, so I'll be taking time off to stay home<br/>
with our 3 yr old.  So, any suggestions of easy, or kid friendly, boxes<br/>
that we can try?  She's definately into rubber stamps, but more along<br/>
the lines of trains &amp; Cinderella.  She doesn't understand how daddy's<br/>
stamps are used differently.  The few times I've recently tried to take<br/>
her boxing, she to so excited about seeing the stamps, she just about<br/>
blew my cover with the muggles around.  So, relatively secluded boxes<br/>
would be a plus.  <br/>
<br/>
I've already pretty much gotten all the ones on lb.org in Sacramento<br/>
county.  Closer would of course be better with gas prices, but I'm<br/>
wondering if my daughter might enjoy the Exporitorium while I got<br/>
Mimulus' Tin Tin series.<br/>

Definitely go for the Exploratorium!  She'll love it!  I went with my 2-month old and found all the stamps stroller accessible.  With a 3-year old you could let her run loose and she would have a blast with all the hands-on displays even if she didn't understand them.  For fewer crowds I'd recommend going on a weekday, but keep in mind that some museums are closed on Mondays.<br/>

Line Alien boxes.  If she likes being outside it's a nice place. There's<br/>
also a playground nearby.  And, if she doesn't already have one, maybe she'd<br/>
enjoy having her own journal for stamping?<br/>
