<br/>
Just got word from a couple that hails from Northern California that <br/>
they stumbled upon one of my letterboxes while seeking out a <br/>
neighboring geocache in WA.  They seemed quite intrigued by <br/>
letterboxing and promised to start looking for letterboxes in their <br/>
neck of the woods when they returned home.  Perhaps this will bode <br/>
well for the letterbox population in N. Ca?  The interesting part <br/>
about this all is that this very letterbox has been responsible for <br/>
leading a couple other folks to letterboxing--one of whom is a <br/>
prolific geocacher/geocache placer from Oregon.  Upon accidentally <br/>
finding this very same letterbox, he immediately went out and found <br/>
80+ some area letterboxes within 2 weeks!!!  He definitely caught <br/>
the 'letterboxing bug'!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail someday,<br/>
