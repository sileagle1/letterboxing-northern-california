                    <div class="plaintext-content">So sorry to hear about the Big Dog... he was on my short list, due for a<br>
visit in the next few weeks.  I hope you find a new spot for him soon; I<br>
can't wait to check him out.<br>
<br>
I'd love to get together for our visitor but don't know what my plans for<br>
the holiday weekend are as yet.  It would be a great opportunity to have<br>
another Bay Area gathering, since it seems like there hasn't been one in a<br>
while.<br>
<br>
I've recently gone through the whole homecare/hospital situation with my<br>
family as well, so best wishes to Doublesaj & Old Blue.  It's never<br>
easy...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well at least the groundskeeper didn't just toss the Doggie!  How about asking the <br>
business that now occupies the former establishment to host the box behind its counter?  <br>
I seem to recall it being a nursery or something now.  That Big Dog is legendary in San <br>
Francisco history and I bet they would be cooperative.  Course that's easy for me to say <br>
since I have never found the courage to ask any business to host a box.<br>
