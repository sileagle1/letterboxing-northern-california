The following was on the Today Show this a.m.  Thought it might <br/>
interest some of the letterboxers because it is similar and <br/>
letterboxers are good at solving clues.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you would have to be able to travel (Amanda) because I <br/>
think the clues will probably involve the whole USA.  If you solve <br/>
all twelve clues you could get a million dollars in jewels or about <br/>
a quarter of the dollar amount in cash.  My dau-in-law and I was <br/>
thinking about purchasing the book and working as a team, but we <br/>
would not be able to travel out of state.  <br/>
<br/>
Copy and paste the following link and check it out.  The RULES link <br/>
is in the upper right corner.  On the left side of the page click on <br/>
JEWELS to view the jewels or the dollar amount then click on the <br/>
CLUES to learn about them.<br/>
<br/>
Someone look into it and see what you think.  If it's going to be <br/>
won, why not by some Letterboxer?<br/>
