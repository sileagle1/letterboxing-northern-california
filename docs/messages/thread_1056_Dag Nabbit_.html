I went to put out the newest part of the Berkeley Rep letterbox, and <br/>
half of this letterbox was missing.  <br/>
<br/>
I just banged together a S.C.L. (seriously crappy logbook) and have <br/>
some more of the Finn in the Underworld thingies.  But the Our Town <br/>
refills for this letterbox are at home.  <br/>
<br/>
I should have some of this back in place by one o'clock.<br/>
<br/>
And in other fast-moving news, Princess Lea has stayed true to her <br/>
astonishing track record, and found Fish Ranch within 48 hours of this <br/>
box's placement.  Way to go Lea!<br/>
