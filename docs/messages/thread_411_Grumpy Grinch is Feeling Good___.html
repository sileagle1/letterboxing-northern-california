Grumpy Grinch has dedicated this weekend to letterboxing.  Friday we <br/>
found 5 boxes on the SF Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
Where's Waldo was intact but the contents were soaked.  We were <br/>
unable to stamp the logbook because it was wet and in tatters.  We <br/>
dried what we could and rebagged.  If Tara is still in the area, she <br/>
might want to rescue poor Waldo.<br/>
<br/>
We were first finders on Go to the Fault, by Anna and the kids.  - a <br/>
nice leg-stretching walk.<br/>
<br/>
Wetlands Hurray, Get to the Point and Siempre Adelante are all dry <br/>
and well.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday was even more fun.  Found Big Giant to start the day and <br/>
picked up the Pegleg Hitchhiker.  Then we were First Finders for the <br/>
two boxes in the Coastside Trail Series.  We found the first three <br/>
boxes in the Sky to the Sea Series.  Didn't try for the last two <br/>
since we were afoot.  Might go back on bicycles someday.<br/>
<br/>
We were happy to find Sierra Sally's Mission Santa Cruz.  Brownie <br/>
Who Lives in the Woods is well, though the logbook is nearly full.  <br/>
Finished Saturday in San Jose.  Walk Like a Duck is a <br/>
letterbox/geocache hybrid, planted 3 days ago.  It had been found <br/>
already by at least half a dozen others, mostly geocachers.  <br/>
Fortunately the stamp is intact!<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to finishing our letterboxing weekend in Oakland on <br/>
Sunday, meeting, exchanging, and improving our carving skills.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who planted boxes to cheer up the Grumpy Grinch!<br/>
<br/>
