the day.  You may have had your license plate number taken as you<br>
exited.  Contrary to popular belief, these had nothing to do with<br>
letterboxing, Renee, or Wassa's son.  We went back today to try<br>
(unsuccessfully) for some leftover boxes, and saw signs up:  at a time<br>
between 4:00 and 4:30 there was a sexual assault in the park.<br>
<br>
The bare bones are reported here: <br>

<br>
We are an outdoorsy community and many people choose to box alone. <br>
Cara and I talked for a good long while about personal safety, and the<br>
line between being safe and letting your life be ruled by others. <br>
Please be careful where you go and when you go.  And if you ever want<br>
company boxing in SJ, let us know.<br>
