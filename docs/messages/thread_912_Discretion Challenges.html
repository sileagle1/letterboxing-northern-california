Last year, I was at Princess Lea's 'Where Buffalo Roam' box, helping <br>
her out by doing a little maintenance (adding logbook pages). <br>
Suddenly 5 teenage boys rode in on bicycles, and proceeded to light <br>
up cigarettes & talk RIGHT THERE! Talk continued on many subjects... <br>
and many cigarettes...<br>
<br>
I waited and waited, and waitied... but got impatient. Then I <br>
realized all the classes I took in improvisational theater in <br>
college could be handy. I whipped out my logbook and pen, and <br>
suddenly stepped into the role of a botanist studying small plant <br>
forms in that area. I pretended to make notes, look at leaves, make <br>
little sketches, and scrutinized the place where the highly rare and <br>
tiny moss-like plant, 'buffalonias roamus' grows.<br>
<br>
The boys quickly became accustomed to me poking around, and it was a <br>
piece of cake to replace the letterbox, without notice. <br>
<br>
I've used similar tactics at other locations -- it can work.<br>

If you sat on the bench next to him and started talking to yourself <br>
in very agitated tones you would have had the bench to yourself in <br>
short order. That is of course unless he started doing the same. How <br>
about pulling out your bible and reading passages aloud? <br>
