SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Where's Sam Spade when you need him?<br/>
<br/>
Thieves have stolen a copy of the bird statue at the heart of "The<br/>
Maltese Falcon" from the San Francisco restaurant used as a setting<br/>
for the 1941 film classic starring Humphrey Bogart as the<br/>
rough-and-tumble private detective.<br/>
<br/>
The small, black figure was swiped over the weekend along with 20<br/>
vintage books, including copies of the 1930 Dashiell Hammett novel on<br/>
which the film is based.<br/>
<br/>
John Konstin, whose restaurant John's Grill bills itself as the "Home<br/>
of the Maltese Falcon," said the thief broke into the case displaying<br/>
the statue over the weekend. Konstin is offering a $25,000 reward for<br/>
the replica's return.<br/>
<br/>
While the statute is not the original movie prop, Konstin said he was<br/>
offering such a big reward because this copy of the Maltese Falcon was<br/>
signed by a cast member from the Bogart film.<br/>
<br/>
"We want it back because of the historical and literary significance,"<br/>
Konstin said in a telephone interview. "It means a lot to us."<br/>
<br/>
The novel is considered the most famous example of hard-boiled fiction<br/>
and was a major influence on writers like Raymond Chandler. The movie<br/>
helped define the film-noir tough-guy hero of the 1940s and 1950s.<br/>
<br/>
In the story, Spade sets out to track the killer of his partner, Miles<br/>
Archer. In doing so, he meets up with a colorful cast of liars, cheats<br/>
and crooks ready to murder to get their hands on the statue, which<br/>
they believe is made of solid gold hidden by black paint but turns out<br/>
to be a fake.<br/>
<br/>
Richard Layman, a Dashiell Hammett expert who has published six books<br/>
on the former detective-turned author, noted that Hammett refers to<br/>
John's Grill in the book and Spade goes there for lamb chops before<br/>
being sent on a wild goose chase after a girl.<br/>
<br/>
He also said Hammett likely ate there in real life because he lived<br/>
near the restaurant and the Pinkerton detective office where he once<br/>
worked was also nearby.<br/>
<br/>
"The irony is that it is a copy that people are so upset about," he<br/>
said in a telephone interview. "I'd go after the fat man and the<br/>
pretty girl," he added in reference to two of the story's villains.<br/>
