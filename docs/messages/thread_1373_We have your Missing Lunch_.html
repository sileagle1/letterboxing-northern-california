Call me and I'll arrange to get all this back to you. I've kept it in my fridge so it's all still good. Home: 530-757-1685. Cell: 530-219-5955<br/>

Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
Da Kool Kats were really having an "off day", today. We hurried to<br/>
get the box of dem xx men before they pulled it and ended up leaving<br/>
our wheeled blue ice chest behind. When we got to the bright lights<br/>
of Vacaville I had Gary pull over so I could make a sandwich and<br/>
discovered the missing ice chest and lunch. We drove back to the park<br/>
but it was gone. I hope it is in the care of one of our letterboxing<br/>
friends. Let us know if you have it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for the wonderful stamps we managed to get. We have got<br/>
to go back another day for quite a few others that we missed. <br/>
<br/>
Carole of Da Kool Kats<br/>
