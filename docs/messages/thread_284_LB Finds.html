Dear Letterboxers,<br>
<br>
First off, we finally carved our stamp.  Up until Friday we have been<br>
using a pre-made purchased stamp.<br>
<br>
Now, we want to pass along information on our week-end "finds."<br>
<br>
11 Finds<br>
Dropped off a hitch hiker and<br>
Picked up a hitch hiker<br>
<br>
We had to go down to the Monterey Peninsula for 2 of the grand kids <br>
birthday celebrations<br>
so thought we would work in a few letter boxes between "here and there."<br>
<br>
We solved and located Vertigo #2.  It was placed by Princesses Lea in <br>
May and we were the First Finders!!!<br>
We already had Vertigo #1, so we are looking forward to #3.<br>
<br>
We were first finders at GrumpyGrinches Bounce Bounce and Lodi Little <br>
Lamplight.  We were also<br>
first and only finders on their first LB.<br>
<br>
We next went to Sunol and picked up He's Gone, by punkin heads.<br>
Since we were close we went over to Union City for the 2 at Tolman's <br>
Peak placed by Lizardbutt's family,<br>
but only managed to get the second one.  The first one was not to be <br>
found.  It was a hot and humid hike.<br>
Much longer than we expected and a bit much for us as we are just <br>
"beginners."<br>
<br>
Our next stop was Mission San Juan Bautista placed by Sierra Sally.  We <br>
found this one at 8:30 p.m. in the dark.<br>
A friendly cat kept us company.<br>
<br>
Saturday we picked up Whales and Sails in Seaside placed by the <br>
mtnbikemanns.  Really nice beach path. <br>
Good for roller blading, biking  walking or jogging.  Well carved stamp <br>
as well.<br>
<br>
We went to the wharf and had calamari at Abolonettis, our favorite place <br>
for calamari and was able to get the<br>
Monterey Letterbox, planted by Princess Lea while we were in the area.  <br>
Then on to Sporty's Play Day by the mtnbikemanns, again.<br>
 From there, we headed down to the 17 Mile Drive gate that is nearby and <br>
found the Seventeen Mile Drive LB.  You can park outside of<br>
the gate and walk in.<br>
<br>
We knew the Wharf Cat LB was a tough hike and we were not going to <br>
attempt it in the heat, but since it was cooler and<br>
rainy today, we thought we would give it a try before heading home.  We <br>
were successful!  Maybe Friday's hike at Tolman's Peak helped, after all.<br>
This one is definitely a cardio work out, so keep this in mind if you <br>
plan on attempting it. We picked up a hitch hiker, Julie is 40, at this <br>
box..  It is<br>
a very, very nicely carved stamp, so be on the look-out for her, who <br>
knows where she's headed next!!!.<br>
<br>
Well, that was the extent of our letterboxing for this week-end.<br>

Congrats on the first finds on Bounce Bounce and Little Lamplight.  <br>
It sounds as if you had a VERY successful weekend!  We spent ours <br>
with grandchildren - not a bad time either.  :-)<br>

I am assuming that you found it to be a bit taxing on the legs.:)<br>
Sorry, I sometimes forget that what I think of as a stroll others <br>
would consider it a hike. Lizardbutt's motto: better to bike it than <br>
hike it whenever possible. If you ever go hunting for the Alameda <br>
Creek Trail series best to follow Lizardbutt's motto. <br>
