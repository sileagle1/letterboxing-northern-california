                    <div class="plaintext-content">A number of people commented on the plastic boxes I used with the<br/>
locking clips on each side.  They are from a company called Lock &amp; Lock<br/>
(www.locknlock.com) out of Korea.  There's a huge variety.  I haven't<br/>
been able to find the right sized ones at any US retailer.  Target sells<br/>
them as set of 5, with only 1 of them probably being small enough for a<br/>
box.  They are also available on a number of organization sites like<br/>
www.organizationetc.com (parter of amazon.com) or houseware sites like<br/>
www.heritagemint.com.  <br/>
<br/>
I got all mine at the big Korean market in Rancho Cordova, Koreana Plaza<br/>
is the name I think.  It's on Olsen, right where Folsom Blvd &amp; Zinfandel<br/>
meet.  They're in the back right corner.  Unfortunately, while they have<br/>
stacks &amp; stacks of them, they don't seem to keep stock of specific sizes<br/>
with any regularity.  They just have what ever was shipped last time.<br/>
The smallest boxes that I used for the Tower Bridge &amp; Golden Spike<br/>
letterboxes were only $1, the Eureaka &amp; Fanny Ann boxes I think were $2.<br/>
Also, I know Da Kool Kats founds some at a Japanese shop in San<br/>
Francisco.  So check out Korean or Asian markets in your area if you<br/>
want to find them.  <br/>
