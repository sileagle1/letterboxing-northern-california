The poll is slightly over a week old and hasn't changed much in the last<br/>
day or so so I thought I'd go ahead and report the results.  It looks like<br/>
definitely August, mid to late August, at the Redwood Regional Park, with<br/>
a potluck meal.  Here are the stats, top results in each category are<br/>
starred:<br/>
<br/>
When?<br/>
Late July (2) 		11%<br/>
* Early August (5) 	28%<br/>
Mid August (4) 		22%<br/>
* Late August (5) 	28%<br/>
September or after (2) 	11%<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second-best when?<br/>
Late July (3) 		17%<br/>
Early August (3) 	17%<br/>
* Mid August (8) 		44%<br/>
Late August (3) 	17%<br/>
September or after (1) 	6%<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where?<br/>
San Francisco (1) 	5%<br/>
* Oakland - Redwood Regional Park (12) 	63%<br/>
Oakland/East Bay - elsewhere (3) 	16%<br/>
South Bay (2) 		11%<br/>
North Bay (1) 		5%<br/>

<br/>
Food?<br/>

Restaurant (2) 		11%<br/>
Not Interested (0) 	0%<br/>

You might wonder why I didn't mention early August when outlining the<br/>
results.  This is because I'm unavailable in early August and don't want<br/>
to plan an event I can't attend.  Hope that's ok. :)<br/>
<br/>
Mid to late August would be either the weekend of the 19th/20th or the<br/>
25th/26th.  More people seemed to be available overall in mid-August but<br/>
I'd be willing to do another poll, or if you just want to post yes/no,<br/>
that's fine too.<br/>
<br/>
The majority has spoken on location - Redwood Regional Park in Oakland. <br/>
Once we pick a weekend I'll look into reserving a table space of some kind<br/>
if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be safe to start encouraging those of you who said you'd plant to<br/>
start carving now? :)<br/>
<br/>
People seem interested in a potluck.  How do you envision this working, if<br/>
you are interested?  Picnic style?  Lunch or dinner?  I'd be interested in<br/>
hearing more about this.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to settle on a date by next Wednesday.  I'm planning on basing<br/>
the decision on what is said here over the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Thanks for doing this! Gatherings are really fun and, I think, worth all the effort. You know you can get additional help from us too, just ask. (For starters, we'll bring a case of bottled water).<br/>
<br/>
August 19 and 20 are highly desirable for us. Sunday the 27th is also doable. If it's the 26th we won't be able to make it : (<br/>
<br/>
Pot luck: everyone bring something to share that can keep in the heat or have an individual ice source. Maybe a sign on your cooler that states "To Share" is in order so we're not shy of snooping in everyone's stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Try to reserve a spot with the most shade you can get.<br/>
<br/>
And, the very most important thing for a successful gathering: Think up a realy cool title for it!!<br/>

We would not be available the 19th nor 20th.  But that should not <br/>
sway the majority.  Perhaps another poll would allow all of us to <br/>
post our preferences and the "majority rule" method would keep the <br/>
decision impartial.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would it be safe to start encouraging those of you who said you'd <br/>

&gt; start carving now? :)<br/>
<br/>
Most definitely.  Do we want to pick a theme, or just carve as the <br/>
whim moves us?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People seem interested in a potluck.  How do you envision this <br/>
working, if<br/>
&gt; you are interested?  <br/>
<br/>
Once the date and time are determined, those who are planning to <br/>
attend could list the general category of food they will contribute, <br/>
e.g. salad, fruit, breads, pasta, meat, buns and chips, desserts, <br/>
beverages, etc.  We'll be able to see what more is needed as the <br/>
contributions are listed.  (Or we just all surprise one another and <br/>
have a truly eclectic meal!)<br/>
