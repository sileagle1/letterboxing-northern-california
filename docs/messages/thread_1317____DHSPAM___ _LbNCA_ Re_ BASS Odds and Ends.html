<br/>
If anyone's still looking for something to contribute to the potluck, <br/>
how about a cooler chest of drinks?  I don't think I saw such a thing on <br/>
the potluck list, but it would be a great thing to have. :)<br/>
<br/>
Cellisimo, I saw that you want to bring hummus &amp; pita chips - I've also <br/>
stocked for that though mine isn't homemade, so please do bring yours if <br/>
you can come (and I hope you can!).  Aahz, I'm so glad you're going to <br/>
be able to join us after all as well!<br/>
<br/>
Tonight I'm throwing together some fruit salad and I've got about 10 <br/>
ears of corn to bring for the grill!  We're going to feast for sure!<br/>
<br/>
See you all tomorrow!<br/>

&gt; today which we will initiate Sunday with vegetarian items.<br/>
