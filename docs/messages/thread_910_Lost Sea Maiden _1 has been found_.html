No....  Surpise! It was the team of Mimulus and Paul in SF, <br/>
discovering the Lost Sea Maiden, instead of the West Indies on <br/>
Columbus Day. We had lunch together, then spent the afternoon plotting <br/>
new letterboxes, looking for boxes, and talking about life. It was a <br/>
great day.<br/>
<br/>
Such a rare event just had to be broadcasted to the LbNCA world!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, soon 'Euras, the East Wind', will be blowing into town. (See, I <br/>
don't give up easily).<br/>
