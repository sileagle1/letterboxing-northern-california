Hi Bonedoc, <br/>
<br/>
Your new hunt is the top of my to do list as well, solved the clues, <br/>
know the trailhead but need a free day to head down south, the <br/>
wildflowers should be beautiful I expect.  That is so great your kid <br/>
is in to it, my 6 year old scoffs at letterboxing although we did <br/>
set up a hunt just for him based on Rocky, Bullwinkle and Gitney and <br/>
Cloyd the moon men.  It involved finding secret clues for a rocket <br/>
fuel recipe he had to make.  A take off on an old R and B espisode.  <br/>
It will be recycled into a LB hunt for all of us soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the going to all the trouble to plant, we will come <br/>
eventually, just like Field of Dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Mim<br/>
