OK, I might have missed the announcement somehow but, does this mean you got the job in Portland? If so, LUCKY dogs! I mean on both sides, 'cuz there are a HECK of a lot of letterboxes up there with the heck-a-lotta letterbox-ers you might assume go aloing with them but THEY are going to be the fortunate ones, getting you both as 'boxers, event planners and, in general, very fun people. <br/>
<br/>
We will surely miss your antics and talent but will expect to hear about all of it in your blog.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!'~~Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue~~<br/>
