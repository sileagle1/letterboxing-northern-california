I crossed the 10 Found mark at lunch today.  I picked up the Folsom <br>
Prison & Folsom Powerhouse boxes, both I'd highly recommend.  <br>
Compasses helpful, but not required.<br>
<br>
I had to walk through a contstruction site to get to the Powerhouse <br>
box, but since the construction was actually in another area, the <br>
workers didn't seem to care.  It was fun to read the log book since <br>
it's been around for so long.  I saw Doublesaj's entry saying it was <br>
the 2nd box they'd found.  There were a lot of other 1st & 2nd timers <br>
that entered in the log.<br>
<br>
The Folsom Prison box has a beautiful stamp & an easy drive-by.  Just <br>
watch out for the chickens.<br>

I am killing time between planes in the Denver airport, catching up with all the posts. Didja miss me? :-) Just wanted to say that I got F100 today!!!!!!! Woo hoo! The box was Ryan's Stone Mountain box. Boy was it COLD the last few days in Georgia. 20 in the mornings, sometimes an added wind chill. Dark doesn't deter me, rain slows me down, but cold was an obstacle, I must say. Anyway, I'll write details when I get home, but couldn't wait to share the news.<br>
