I have a friend who wanted to find a box or two tomorrow on her way from<br/>
Marin County to Sebastopol. She has hurt her foot and can't walk far. Does<br/>
anyone know of any short walk/driveby boxes on her way? There are some in<br/>
Petaluma, like the Simpson series. Anyone done those and know if they are<br/>
do-able? Let me know asap so I can pass the info on before the end of<br/>
tonight (she leaves in the morning).<br/>
Also, let me know of any other short walk/driveby boxes around Marin,<br/>
Sonoma, Oakland, or SF. She will be hobblin for awhile and would like some<br/>
short ones for other days.<br/>
She found The Jungle Inn today as her very first box (nice short walk).<br/>
Maybe I can get her hooked. Saw Princess Lea was stamped in there earlier<br/>
today. Very cool. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

Yup, I was on the all-bonedoc tour today, starting at The Jungle Inn <br/>
and including Alpine Dam (first finder and it's been up there for 3 <br/>
months!) and the 4 Marfan boxes.  We had our 4-footed letterboxer Rex <br/>
with us so we were not able to make it to other Marin LB locations such <br/>
as Mt. Tam and China Camp since the doggies are not welcome there.<br/>
<br/>
I was also in a bookstore today looking at a picture book of old <br/>
Oakland and there was a whole map of Joaquin Miller's compound and I  <br/>
thought to myself, "gee, someone should really do some letterboxes up <br/>
there!"  Glad the Alien Explorers were already on it.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding short walk/drive by boxes, off the top of my head I thought <br/>
of:<br/>
<br/>
My boxes<br/>
Trefoil Girl Scout Cookie (Oakland)<br/>
Sushi House (Alameda)<br/>
Playland (San Francisco) - although many people have been unable to <br/>
find this one, so maybe not so good for a person new to the hobby<br/>
Zin Country (Sonoma County mystery)<br/>
<br/>
Others I have found<br/>
Say Cheese! (Petaluma)<br/>
Star Crossed (San Francisco)<br/>
Semper Fi (San Francisco)<br/>
American Graffiti (Petaluma)<br/>
Sea Creatures (Coast)<br/>
