Hi All,<br>
<br>
We recently spend a week in San Francisco during a spell of fabulous <br>
weather.  We were able to enjoy it while doing a bit of boxing.  We <br>
wished we had time for more; however here's the lowdown on our finds <br>
and attempts.<br>
<br>
FOUND:<br>
Star-crossed- Amazing stamp!!<br>
G3 Conservatory of Flowers 1 and 3- Both boxes in good shape. <br>
Yes, Noe!- What a lovely street with creative clues.<br>
<br>
ATTEMPTS:<br>
Corousel's Pink Treat- We were sure we were in the right locations, <br>
but no sign of the box.  Maybe it was only there during the recent <br>
gathering--?<br>
G3 Conservatory of Flowers 2- Found the exact locale, but no box.<br>
Playland Lives!- ditto<br>
<br>
We'd love to know if anyone has info on our attempts.  And thank you <br>
to the planters for your efforts.  We appreciated them during our <br>
sojourn.  :><br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had an email last week that suggested the Carousel's Pink Treat  was <br>
missing but we were in GG Park on Sept 25th and Playland Lives was there.<br>
<br>
Star Crossed IS a wonderful stamp!<br>
<br>
Did you try Redcrest Fairyland on your way home? We've replaced the box and <br>
stamp since it went missing. . .<br>
<br>
Hey, we get up to Eureka about 4X a year. It would be lovely to schedule an <br>
exchange next time we're up if you're interested.<br>

Star Cross'd was a fantastic stamp!<br>
