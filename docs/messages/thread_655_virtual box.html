Dear Black Cavalier, <br/>
<br/>
I personally love the idea of a virtual box...I like more unusual <br/>
twists on the typical hunt and welcome any opportunity to indulge <br/>
that.  I planned my virtual box  more out of lack of leisure time and <br/>
the fact its a 5 hour drive round trip to Sacramento.  I had planned <br/>
to keep the box with me at home after GRR and then list it as a <br/>
virtual box on AQ and LBNA sites. People can email with the answers <br/>
and I will mail them the a piece of paper with the stamp imprint <br/>
(suitable for framing!)  There are several such boxes on those sites <br/>
already (see the past posts in re: virtual boxing) and it varies from <br/>
being given a link to someones personal website where you can down <br/>
load the stamp image or it is mailed to you once you have solved the <br/>
puzzle.  YOu are right, to mail the box aroudn gets pricey.<br/>
<br/>
I also like bonedoc's idea of anatomy questions.....I will bring along <br/>
an old textbook or at least he can be easy on us and accept ansers <br/>
like "Shinbone".  <br/>
