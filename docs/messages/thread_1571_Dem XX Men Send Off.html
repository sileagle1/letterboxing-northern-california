Please send a shout out if you are definitely going to be there, or if<br/>
you think you might, so I can get a general head count for the nice<br/>
folks setting up tables.<br/>

There is parking in the rear behind Buffalo Bills, with a couple of<br/>
handicap spaces, but then you have to walk around to the front of the<br/>
building anyhow.<br/>

We'd love to meet up with you all for one last time before we hit the<br/>
road.  (Feel free to bring cooties and hitchhikers that you want moved<br/>
up the coast).<br/>

See you there!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Big hugs to your both and wishing you the jobs of your dreams,   <br/>
&gt; fabulous digs and a neighborly welcome that all humans deserve.<br/>
<br/>
That was so nicely put I'll just have to say "ditto"! I guess Funhog<br/>
will be happy to have you in her backyard. Our gatherings won't be<br/>
the same without you!<br/>
<br/>
I will be hiking up Mt. Tallac on Sunday, but I'll give you a shout-out<br/>
when I get to the top &amp; hope you'll have safe and fun travels. (Take the<br/>
coast route! there are killer letterboxes!)<br/>

&gt; What?!  Dem XX Men are leaving town!  That's right, Dorks Anonymous is<br/>
&gt;  relocating our outpost to Portland.  Silicon Valley has far more<br/>
&gt; geeks than dorks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where: Buffalo Bills Brew Pub<br/>
&gt; 1082 B ST.<br/>
&gt; Hayward, CA 94541<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When: Sunday, July 22nd (thats this week) at 2 pm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please send a shout out if you are definitely going to be there, or if<br/>
&gt; you think you might, so I can get a general head count for the nice<br/>
&gt; folks setting up tables.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is parking in the rear behind Buffalo Bills, with a couple of<br/>
&gt; handicap spaces, but then you have to walk around to the front of the<br/>
&gt; building anyhow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We'd love to meet up with you all for one last time before we hit the<br/>
&gt; road.  (Feel free to bring cooties and hitchhikers that you want moved<br/>
&gt; up the coast).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See you there!  <br/>

BTW, anyone available Monday afternoon (a week from today) in San Francisco<br/>
for picking up some of Paul's new boxes? Are they even planted yet?<br/>
