merely to wave as we departed early.  Unfortunately, both Grumpy and <br>
Grinch were slightly under the weather and we had an EARLY call Sunday <br>
with little Grandchildren.<br>
<br>
We are planning to return to Lagoon Valley this coming week to seek <br>
what so many of you placed (and found).  Thanks for all your efforts.  <br>
We hope to reclaim our carving materials before the next gathering so <br>
that we can repay some of your many efforts.<br>
