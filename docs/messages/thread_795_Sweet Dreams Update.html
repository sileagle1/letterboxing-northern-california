                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just completed a maintenance check on the Sweet Dreams Series in<br>
Petaluma.  All is well and in good shape.  One box was exposed, but<br>
all was there.  At two of the boxes, the entire town of Petaluma<br>
decided to show up so we ended up waiting around with binoculars for<br>
5-10 minutes, looking like birders.  Hikers moved on quickly, and we<br>
were able to finish rehiding with no problems. <br>
<br>
I did notice that in two spots, there had been significant park<br>
maintenance done.  Both boxes were fine.  I suspect one box had to<br>
have been discovered by the park crew, but the rock was neatly placed<br>
over the box.  <br>
