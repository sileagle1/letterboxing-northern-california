Hi,<br/>
  I just found out about letterboxing today &amp; am very intrigued.  <br/>
I've heard about geocaching before but always thought using a GPS was <br/>
cheating.  Letterboxing seems so much more civilized.<br/>
  Since I work at Intel in Folsom, CA, I figured I'd start out with <br/>
the ones in town during lunch.  So far, I'm unable to find where Cohn <br/>
part is in Folsom.  Can anyone get me started with the location?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

don't know of a cohn park, but perhaps you mean historic cohn mansion<br/>

My first recommendation for Folsom would be the FOLSOM series at<br/>
Castle Park on Prewitt.  Three very, very nice stamps on a nice "one<br/>
mile loop" walk.  Be careful to get the right park, because there are<br/>
two parks almost side by side.  Next try the FOLSOM PRISON box.  The<br/>
POWER HOUSE may be difficult to get to right now, because they are<br/>
doing construction at the site.  We managed to sneak in several weeks<br/>
ago.  It might be a muddy trek at this time, even if you did manage to<br/>
get in.  The Cohn Park stamps are near a school and if you follow the<br/>
clues, you'll have to go through the school playground, although<br/>
school is out for the holidays, so this may be a good time to give it<br/>
a try.   <br/>
<br/>
Do you know how to search for these clues?  If not, let me know and I<br/>
will help you.<br/>

Hi Matthew,<br/>
  Thanks for the help.  On letterbox.org, there are 2 sets of boxes <br/>
listed as being in Cohn park in Folsom.  The titles are "Folsom" <br/>
&amp; "Folsom's Cohn Park".  They look to have been placed by the same <br/>
person, Diane, earlier this spring.<br/>

I'm not sure what you mean by "seach for these clues".  Do you mean <br/>
following the directions in the clues, or finding the clues <br/>
themselves?  I've printed out the 4 Folsom clues from Lb.org so I've <br/>
got that part covered.  <br/>

I'm trying to catch up with emails now that we are back in town...and this may already be answered...but we got the Cohn park series awhile back....great stamps and great spots!  I think we located it by using "Castle Park" - I believe that is a neighborhood reference. Hope it helps!  The Folsom Prison stamp was excellent too!<br/>

Take care, BugZ<br/>
