<br/>
Iron`Bear and I are planning a quick trip to Northern California <br/>
next week to take care of some family business and grab some <br/>
letterboxes while we are out there  we should be heading down <br/>
Monday and back on Thursday. We will be in the Auburn area Monday <br/>
and Sacramento/Yuba City/Marysville area on Tuesday and Wednesday. <br/>
If anyone would like to get together for a quick exchange somewhere <br/>
or perhaps meet up for lunch somewhere that many of us could meet <br/>
and exchange please let me know ASAP  you can email me at <br/>
hispandora at phlsystems.com or just leave me a message here!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet some of you next week<br/>
Pandora{I`B}<br/>
