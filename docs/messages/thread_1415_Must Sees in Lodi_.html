must &amp; I think in the general Lodi area  (maybe between Lodi &amp;<br/>
Stockton).  &amp; you have to go in to the store to understand the stamp.<br/>
Spencer's Bone is a nice walk in the woods, but I'm pretty sure that's<br/>
where I got poison oak, probably not a problem now.  Calaveras River<br/>
Trail is a nice walk along the river.  Tiger Tale nice walk on UOP<br/>
campus.  Last 2 are in or around Stockton.  I there's one other in Lodi,<br/>
but you have to figure that one out yourself.<br/>

I agree with Nils.  You'll like the Alien Smorgasbord, especially if <br/>
you go inside the establishment to see what inspired it.  If you are <br/>
coming over on 580 to 205 you'll go right past it. <br/>

Perhaps I need to clarify.  Any must haves in Lodi are no longer <br/>
there, except for Lodi Libations.  Without looking, I think you got <br/>
the Lodi Libations, which by the way, is a very nice stamp, the last <br/>
time you were over this way.  Tiger Tale is quite nice, as well.  We <br/>
first tried for this one in the dark; no surprise there, and had to go <br/>
back during the day.  <br/>
<br/>
If you come over through the Delta, you might try to get the one by <br/>
Don and Gwen.  We haven't made it to this one, but I'm sure it will be <br/>
a great stamp considering who planted it. <br/>
<br/>
Once again, not much left in the Stockton/Lodi area.  Enjoy the drive.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are exactly right.  We wanted to see the cranes, and perhaps pick<br/>
up a few easy-ish letterboxes.  Robb will be pretty tired, but any<br/>
drive by letterboxes would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
We might swing by Consumnes River Preserve (or however you spell<br/>
that), because we had such great bird watching the year we went there<br/>
during the sandhill crane festival.<br/>
