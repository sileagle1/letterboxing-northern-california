(or summer, anyway), I am continuing to compile the official<br>
publication of the whole thing.  If you have already planted, or if<br>
you will be doing so before 10 p.m. the night before the event, you<br>
can get your clues printed and distributed in this most illustrious of<br>
periodicals.  I have already gotten a few clues submissions (thank you<br>
for being so on top of things!).<br>
<br>
Please email them to me at hmoonc@yahoo.com  Please be sure to include<br>
the name of the box, and any illustrations you would like to go with<br>
it (the pics should be no bigger than 5" x 8").  <br>
<br>
If you want them to be in the zine, I need them emailed to me no later<br>
than 10 p.m. of Saturday the 26th.  I will be doing a midnight run to<br>
Kinko's to print the whole thing out.  <br>
<br>
Email me with any questions/concerns/comments/suggestions.  --Thx,<br>
