you can check this place out sometime:<br/>
Han Kook Supermarket, 1092 East El Camino Real,Sunnyvale, CA, 94085<br/>
<br/>
We have a Korean market up here near SF and they carry the lock n<br/>
locks for 1.29-1.79. The maxi locks sound pretty good too, but if the<br/>
.99 cent store doens't always have them, you might check to see if Han<br/>
Kook has something.<br/>
