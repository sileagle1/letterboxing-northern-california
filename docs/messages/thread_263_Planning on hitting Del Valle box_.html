<br/>
I was in a rush when I placed the Del Valle box in Livermore and <br/>
didn't have my stamp-carving tools with me. Hench, the stamp I put <br/>
there isn't up to my usual quality. However, I don't live in NorCal <br/>
and won't be up there any time soon to replace it.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering... is there anyone up there who is planning on <br/>
hitting that box some time in the next few months (and it's not an <br/>
easy box to hit, you must rent a boat and climb rocks)? And if so, <br/>
could you please contact me? If I mailed the new stamp to you, would <br/>
you be willing to take it with you and leave it in the box for me? <br/>
<br/>
I know at least one person has already hit the box since I planted <br/>
it, and I'd really like to place a nicer stamp there since it's such <br/>
a challenge to get to. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I need a reliable volunteer with lots of guts...since the place <br/>
where the box is isn't exactly a kosher place for going ashore, if <br/>
that makes any sense. ;-)<br/>
