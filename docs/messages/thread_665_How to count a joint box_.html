BugZ has one of ours that they will be taking to GRR. We will not count it. I realize that some folks have an exact record that readilly comes to mind of their Ps &amp; Fs, etc.and that great , but we aren't into that. I have kept an image in our book for the one we sent up to GRR, but it will be sent back to us and will be planted somewhere else and we will count it then. If BugZ wants to count it as a plant, and they will be doing the planting, I think that they should count it as a full P. Think of the planter that only plants a store bought, does the store get credit for 1/2 of a plant?  <br/>
Now here is how we tend to make up on those counts (we do have numbers in the book and keep track there) - For birthday gifts we(Gwen &amp; I) plant a letterbox for each other, in our joint book one of us lists it as a P, and when it is found by the other person we list it as an F. So in that case we get both a P&amp;F, and is that cheating?, heck it's our book !<br/>
Count it the way you want to.<br/>

  I have volunteered to plant Nebiru Clan's Old Sac stamp for the GRR, but<br/>
  I'm not sure how to count it.  Since carving the stamp is the majority<br/>
  of the work of a box, I don't feel right in counting it as a Plant.  Has<br/>
  anyone done joint plants before?  Is there a JP count?  Or should I add<br/>

&gt; Since carving the stamp is the majority<br/>
&gt; of the work of a box, I don't feel right in counting it as a Plant.  <br/>
<br/>
That's not necessarily true.  Other times, the clue takes FAR more<br/>
effort to create than the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
P stands for plants, and I think the person who PLANTED it should get<br/>
the credit.  There's a world of rubber stamp carvers out there that<br/>
have never hidden a box at all, and I'd raise my eyebrow if one of<br/>
them started letterboxing and said they have a P-count of 5383 just<br/>
because they carved that many stamps.  Unless it's actually planted,<br/>
it counts for nothing but as a C-count, at best.  (Carved-count)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Has anyone done joint plants before?  Is there a JP count?  Or should<br/>
&gt; I add half a box to my P count?<br/>
<br/>
Typically, with joint plants (that is, both people worked to *plant*<br/>
the box and create the clues, not one person who carved it and another<br/>
person who planted it), both people will take credit for it as a<br/>
plant.  Some people seem to prefer that the person who did the most<br/>
work hiding the box or creating the clue gets the credit.  *shrug* <br/>
But nobody I know takes credit for a plant just because they carved<br/>
the stamp in question.<br/>
<br/>
On the plus side, it also means you can go out and still count the box<br/>
as a find.  The LbNA rules say you can't count a planted box as a<br/>
find, if you're counting it as a plant, it's ineligible for finding. <br/>
Therefore, letting the person who actually planted it get the plant<br/>
credit, you can still get the found credit.  =)<br/>

Well you know me, and I have done just this, along with Amanda's help.  <br/>
I carved the 2 Felicity stamps which she planted in Williamsburg VA <br/>
when she was in the area.  Personally I think finding a spot for the <br/>
boxes is often the hardest (i.e. time consuming) part. I did write the <br/>
clues and post them, but it's still a joint effort.  I can't decide <br/>
what we decided in the end about the "statistics."  I count them both <br/>
as plants and I think Amanda was considering doing so also.  We thought <br/>
about splitting it (one plant each) but then decided that since there <br/>
are no rules anyway, we were ethically in the clear if we both wanted <br/>
to count them as Ps.<br/>
