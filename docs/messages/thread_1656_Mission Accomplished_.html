Just completed my mission to visit all 21 of the California missions. <br/>
Went to and placed a letterbox at San Jose. Also replaced the <br/>
letterboxes at Santa Clara and San Juan Bautista. <br/>
<br/>
Looked for a few other letterboxes too. You all are a creative group! <br/>
I'll email you directly so I won't spoil anybody's clues<br/>

Congrats....<br/>
I've always wanted to tour all the Missions, we have "seen" about 8-10 <br/>
of them, and now with some letterboxes (and an opportunity to plant <br/>
some more) the rest are in our sites!<br/>

I love the CA missions, and I need to go back to some of them for the<br/>
letterboxes, because I went to them all before starting boxing.<br/>

<br/>
I put all my clues on the LBNA website, I keep thinking I'll post to <br/>
Atlasquest too, but I never seem to get around to it. <br/>
Many of the boxes at the missions have gone missing. I try to keep <br/>
the LBNA website updated when I get reports of missing boxes. The <br/>
missions are especially challenging to keep boxes alive at since the <br/>
grounds are usually very well cared for. <br/>
