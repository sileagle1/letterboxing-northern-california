Talk about low-brow taste in TV, we've got a friend who writes for <br>
South Park; she even used to write for Saturday Night Live.  <br>
Honestly, I've never even seen an entire episode of SP but it's <br>
interesting to actually know somebody involved in TV.  ;)<br>
<br>
On a different note, we just returned home from our 3 week 3,000 <br>
mile jaunt in and around CA, OR & WA and will post updates on <br>
regional boxes shortly.  Found many awesome boxes and weren't so <br>
successful with a couple dozen of others--not sure if they were <br>
boxes already 'known' to be missing or not. We'll contact planters <br>
individually in a little bit.<br>

If you haven't yet, check out, "Vertigo", "Shadow of a <br>
Doubt" "Birds" and "American Graffiti" boxes-way cool!(If I do say <br>
so myself & I do).<br>
They take you to places in the films that make people go "squee"(me, <br>
I usually go "whoa"!). The letterboxer would say, "cool another box <br>
with a cool handcarved stamp" & the fan would be doubly stoked.<br>
The Simpsons are my favs and Id prefer to carve something im <br>
interested in (and my kids think the stamps are great-so that's <br>
enough for me). Do what you want. If you carve it, they will come.<br>

I haven't watched South Park much myself, but I did see the one where <br>
Robert Smith from the Cure was on the show (he was some kind of god who <br>
came to save the world??) - that is pure genius.  Plus, I also thought <br>
Team America: World Police was hilarious - not a movie for everyone, <br>
but I could not stop singing the theme song all week (unfortunately <br>
it's R-rated and I cannot repeat it here)<br>

Probably you'll get more clueless finders than ones who know EXACTLY <br>
WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT!!! but it's nice to see someone's enthusiasm <br>
about a topic.  Plus, who knows, maybe we might actually learn <br>
something along the way.  I think I heard about a series of LBs up <br>
north that feature fishing flies - not something that interests me in <br>
the least, but I bet the hand carved images are super and I'd love to <br>
have them in my book.<br>
