<br/>
However, I was dismayed by what looks to be the systematic, <br/>
intentional removal of three of my boxes.  These boxes were in fairly <br/>
difficult to locate places, not prone to accidental discovery, and <br/>
within close proximity of each other.  The pilferage of one of these <br/>
boxes required the perpetrator to remove a rather large rock and <br/>
another to climb up into the lower fronds of a palm tree.<br/>
<br/>
As you can imagine, I find the recent events disheartening to the <br/>
extent that I am vowing to never place another box in Antioch.  There <br/>
is just no respect for other peoples' things there...<br/>

There have been more and more reports about intentional vandalism <br/>
going on in many different areas. There was some one targeting <br/>
dvn2rkrs a year or so back. In the east there was another idiot that <br/>
posted challenges to another placer via 'contact the placer' <br/>
function, and threatening to keep removing their boxes.<br/>
The bottom line is that as letterboxing gains popularity, it too <br/>
will gain its share of jerks. The one thing that you can do is not <br/>
publicise their names on a chatlist(if you know it)so that they <br/>
might get bored of their little vandalism game and move on.<br/>
I think you might be correct in not planting in a certain area if <br/>
you are having problems there. It could be juveniles that have no <br/>
access to a car, and can only ride to a letterbox on a bike.<br/>
