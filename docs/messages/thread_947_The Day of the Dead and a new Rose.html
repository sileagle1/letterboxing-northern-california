                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes! It sure was a great and fun evening! I had a blast seeing <br/>
lisascenic again (the last time being at my family's place in NY <br/>
this summer). I also met Robb, who is a fun, outgoing guy, and an <br/>
outstanding letterboxer as well. <br/>
<br/>
One VERY special moment last night was when a beautiful little girl <br/>
named Rose (blonde hair &amp; Big Blue Eyes) walked in carrying a <br/>
fabulous red alligater leather bound logbook, and stamped in for the <br/>
VERY FIRST TIME, becoming our newest letterboxer! That was exactly <br/>
what I really like to see happening... one less child stuck to a TV, <br/>
and turned on to the creativity and healthy fun of this pastime.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, I was carving my Boreas, God of the North Wind stamp, <br/>
outdoors, across the street in the park. Rose and her mom were <br/>
having a picnic lunch on the next bench. Rose came over to ask me <br/>
what I was doing. I showed her the stamps and explained the basics <br/>
of Lb'ing to her mom.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this now merits me creating a new box called, "A Rose for <br/>
Rose", dedicated to all parents who introduce their kids to valuable <br/>
learning activities, such as letterboxing. This will echo <br/>
lisascenic's rose box in Oakland, but on this side of the Bay.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, guys!<br/>
