projects and the fact I have gone back to work part time.  It has <br>
been  weeks since doing anything remotely connectd to letterboxing.  <br>
Thanks to Douublesaj and Old Blue I got my mind wrapped around lbing <br>
this weekend and can feel the bug taking hold....<br>
<br>
Last week I heard the Exploratorium curator and Liz Hickok of jello <br>
fame www.lizhickok.com talk about the Materials Reconsidered <br>
exhibit.  Some of you may remember Lisascenic kindly posted a link <br>
to her jello city awhile back and I believe Paul went to greet it a <br>
few weeks back (with tabula rasa) at the opening night.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, being of delicate nature, it was only there that night, but <br>
is scheduled to make a  reappearance (freshly constructed) on <br>
Saturday April 1st at some earthquake event at the Exploratorium.  I <br>
thought perhaps the BAy Area Letterboxers could use that an excuse <br>
for some kind of gathering at the EXploratorium or points close by <br>
like the Warming Hut at Crissy Field.  <br>
<br>
What does everyone think?  WOuldn't it be great if Robb walked in <br>
with Lisa (with or without balloon animals).<br>
