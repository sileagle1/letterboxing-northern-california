contacted after they planted a cache right on top of my Rose series. <br/>
We were curious to try out geocaching, and they were interested to see<br/>
what letterboxing was all about.  (My Rose boxes were the first they<br/>
had heard of letterboxing.)<br/>
<br/>
We met up near Lake Merritt in Oakland, where each of our group had<br/>
hidden something.  Both parties were impressed with the creativity and<br/>
sneakiness of the others.  Hmmmmm.....  Those geocachers are pretty<br/>
sneaky.  But we proved that we're very quick finders!<br/>
<br/>
Then we went out to Emeryville, and the sky let loose with rain.  It<br/>
seems that Emeryville is tearing up the shoreline, and unfortunately,<br/>
the Ig Pay Atin Lay East Bay box is missing.  I plan to re-plant this<br/>
one, so stay tuned.  We had planned to share a few other boxes out<br/>
that-a-way, but the weather was too nasty.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed down to Fourth Street in Berkeley, and did a<br/>
multiple-stage geocaching series, which was very very clever.  We<br/>
actually were trying to get some coffee, but any place that was open<br/>
didn't have seating.  <br/>
<br/>
And while we were out, our friends figured out the Mystery Mini Box in<br/>
Berkeley, which was less crowded than I have ever seen it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we're home, and making a batch of hot cocoa.<br/>
