<br/>
I'm not quite sure if I should address this issue, but I guess I just <br/>
want to make sure that we all know not to reveal any spoilers on the <br/>
group board (especially the location of a mystery box).  Laura's <br/>
response about the Fish Out of Water clue was fine (unless Tara, as the <br/>
owner of the box objects) - just please try to follow her lead in not <br/>
giving away too much.  Keep in mind that some planters make their clues <br/>
deliberately challenging.  This serves 2 purposes:  1) to make the box <br/>
less vulnerable to vandals and 2) to make you feel so much more proud <br/>
of yourself when you solve the clue and find the box - gloating is <br/>
permitted.  Probably it is best to ask the planter for clues first - <br/>
that way they can control how much additional help they wish to <br/>
provide.  And just so no one feels bad, I figured out the first part of <br/>
this clue okay, but had to ask Tara for help on part 2 also.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, on the subject of the next Northern California gathering, <br/>
there are no immediate plans for one.  We had one at the end of July <br/>
and it seems like there would be interest in having one again next <br/>
year.   Unfortunately I don't have the time and energy to plan one <br/>
again (at least until after nursing school is over - circa February <br/>
2006), but probably you could coerce DoubleSaj, Tara and Paul to get <br/>
something started sooner than later.  Also, anyone interested in <br/>
joining the planning committee is always more than welcome.  We've had <br/>
them in the East Bay and San Francisco so far, so maybe the next one <br/>
should be in Marin?  Or South Bay?  Monterey?  Santa Rosa (picture me <br/>
waving to Mimulus here)?<br/>

Your point is well taken about spoilers, that's why I asked for help <br/>
off-line.  I asked here since I don't know how to reach Tara.  <br/>
There's no "contact the placer" when I pull up her clue.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, when I looked at the clue online, I discovered that our <br/>
printer was deleting several words at the end of each sentence.  No <br/>
wonder we couldn't make heads or tails out of the text!  (No, that's <br/>
not an excuse for our brain freezes- just an added ice cube.)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the suggestions to those who wrote to us.   <br/>

I would have gladly given a clue if emailed (my email address is on my home page: www.taralowry.com but not on each individual clue page--maybe I should add that...).  Lots of people have found Fish Out of Water.  <br/>
As far as a gathering goes...I would love to help plan another one, but I honestly have no idea how much longer I'm going to live in Daly City.  My husband is in the Marine Corps, and he just reinlisted, so we are going to be moving who knows where who knows when.  The move will probably take place in the next few months.  We might be moving to Quantico, VA!!  I hate to leave CA, but at least there will be plenty of LBs out there!<br/>
