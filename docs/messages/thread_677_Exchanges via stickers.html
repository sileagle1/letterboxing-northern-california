While we have no accurate count of our Xes, we very much value the personal contact and the limited time we spend with our fellow letterboxers. To rush the process seems a shame. I would rather look at some of the exchange stamps we have in our book and recall the experience of meeting other boxers. That is merely my opinion, and as everyone is aware I am somewhat reluctant to offer it.  Sure!<br>
