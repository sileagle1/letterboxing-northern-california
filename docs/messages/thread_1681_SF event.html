that SF had great boxes, and now I know that it also has some fun <br>
boxers as well.  I'm really pleased to know that something as momentus <br>
as a 200th exchange took place at our event.<br>
<br>
I will be back in SF this September.  It would be great to meet up <br>
with any (or all!) of you again.<br>
<br>
Paul, I'm awfully sorry to hear about the heart attack but I'm glad <br>
that you went to the hospital instead of trying to come and meet us.<br>
