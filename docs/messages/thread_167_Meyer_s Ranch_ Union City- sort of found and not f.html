                    <div class="plaintext-content">Took a nice morning walk to find the Meyer's Ranch letterboxes in Union City. A great little <br/>
trail but sadly no boxes for us.<br/>
<br/>
We found the remains of one in the creek. Box was in pieces and a few yards downstream <br/>
we found most of the logbook. Stamp was nowhere to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't find the second one either - although I have to admit we didn't spend that much <br/>
time looking around for it.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up and trashed out the remains of the first box - no sense in leaving bits of <br/>
plastic scattered in the creek. And we've got the logbook too. Lizardbutt's Mom - let me <br/>
know if you'd like me to mail the logbook to you. Or maybe I can try to figure a way to get <br/>
it to you at the SF gathering.<br/>
<br/>
cheers,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dang! Thanks for this sad bit of info. I'll check on the other box <br/>
this week. The first box went missing once before- not the best <br/>
location for a box. The second box should be well hidden, unless some <br/>
rodent walked off with it. You can keep the logbook as your reward <br/>
since you were kind enough to hunt down the remaining contents of the <br/>
box and clean up the mess. Did you notice the blackberries?  <br/>
Excellent berries to use in a pie. <br/>
