On way into SF yesterday tried to get GGBridge box, but couldnt look <br/>
very long/well w/ranger truck parked nearby &amp; incredible winds too!<br/>
(maybe tomorrow)...but while up north today I cut outta work early <br/>
and stopped by Holi canoli batman to get the stamp again(lost <br/>
original sheet I had used) and headed out to find Birds1. Found it <br/>
this time. Great Stamp!<br/>
    Also would like to welcome fellow Petalumian(?)Moon Rabbit to <br/>
the LBNCA group. Come and visit her Shollenberger Park box(which is <br/>
about 3 minutes from my house-nice and convenient) in town!<br/>
The (W)Rabbits are runnin' amuck in Petaluma!<br/>

Hey Wascally Wabbit!  You can now add your X to your tagline!  We were<br/>
with the "Boxalots" in SLRSP and exchanged with you and Flower on the<br/>
trail!  I can't wait to start logging my tagline too!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much to the Boxalots (Bugz, Antz and EZ2Love) for getting my<br/>
family out and about and exploring this great state!  We're new to CA<br/>
and LBing and are loving it!<br/>

Thanks for the plug, Wascally Wabbit!  Shollenberger<br/>
is  my first box and what fun it was to do...all the<br/>
scouting out ahead, clues, etc.  Interesting how<br/>
addictive all this is...and it's not like I didn't<br/>
have anything else to do!  I'm now contemplating and<br/>
beginning scouting for places on the new Riverwalk...<br/>
