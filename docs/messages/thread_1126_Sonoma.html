&gt; I/we must have missed the post about a Sonoma Gathering.  The last one<br/>
&gt; we saw mentioned was the one to be hosted by the Boxalots and<br/>
&gt; Gatorlovers in the Fairfield area.  What became of this one?<br/>
<br/>
The Sonoma gathering is just a mini meet and greet, in honor of Brandy <br/>
(aka Chrissy) who is going to be in town from CT for her spring break.  <br/>
However, at this time it's looking a little iffy because we haven't <br/>
heard from the guest of honor and so don't have a firm date <br/>
established.  We have it narrowed down to Tuesday the 18th or Wednesday <br/>
the 19th, but she may not be available either of those dates, so we are <br/>
in a wait and see pattern.<br/>
<br/>
But hey, Boxalots and Gatorlovers - are you still planning to host an <br/>
event?  Let's pick a date and theme!<br/>
