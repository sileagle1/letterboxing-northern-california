Unfortunately, the tiny logbook was damp &amp; most of the stamp inks had<br/>
run.  The Blue Family recorded finding it damp in Feb, so hopefully it<br/>
won't mildew.  The stamp is a great, the view is incredible &amp; my wife<br/>
tells me the wine is great, so I'd recommend it.  Take the wine cave<br/>
tour too, very interesting.  Maybe someone nearby could take this poor<br/>
stray in out of the rain &amp; dry it out by the fire.<br/>
<br/>
I also was able to pick up the Neighborhood school box in Dixon.  Easy<br/>
20 minute detour for anyone going through Dixon during they day.  The<br/>
box planter (the school principal I think) was very nice &amp; glad to meet<br/>
another boxer.  I was only the 2nd person to get the stamp &amp; I think<br/>
it's been around since October.<br/>
