I've been lurking on this list for a few months, just kind of soaking <br/>
in the letterboxing community, but this weekend I'll be heading out <br/>
for my first box(es).  I'll be letterboxing with my 9 year old <br/>
daughter, zairabear.<br/>
<br/>
We've carved our personal stamps and looked up a few clues on <br/>
letterboxing.org, but I'm curious if there's anything else we should <br/>
pack with our lb supplies when we go ahunting.  My checklist at the <br/>
moment:<br/>
<br/>
personal stamp<br/>
inkpad<br/>
log book<br/>
clue(s)<br/>
camera<br/>
<br/>
Any input would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Also, next weekend we'll be giong to the Ren Faire up in Novato and <br/>
may have time to look for a few boxes (depending on who ends up in <br/>
which cars for the drive from the South Bay).  In searching the <br/>
archives here i noticed that The Jungle Inn by bonedoc had been <br/>
removed during Faire in the spring.  Is this hostel active now?  <br/>
Should we stumble across a HH I'd love to drop it by a hostel :-)<br/>

A pen to write notes and handiwipes to clean ink off<br/>
of hands are my recommendation. <br/>
<br/>
Markers can be handy in case you come across a large<br/>
stamp.<br/>

Welcome to this addictive hobby!<br/>
<br/>
Depending on where we're hunting for boxes (i.e., drive-bys or hikes, <br/>
etc.), we bring a backpack that has working-gloves (for digging through <br/>
prickers or scruff), a flashlight, and a camel-bak (with LOTS of water). <br/>
<br/>
I'm excited you've joined our clan!  Hopefully you can attend the next <br/>
gathering and we can all meet you and chat more.<br/>
Good luck and have fun!<br/>

  I don't know if you're a member of the Letterboxing USA yahoo group,<br/>
in the group's File folder is an overly comprehensive list of what<br/>
people bring:<br/>
http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cIwpQ2VdtdtU8xdmTbWd4x7PZk-1bKrS-zIRtMZYLit<br/>

/What%27s%20in%20your%20kit%3F<br/>
<br/>
Other things that I bring that haven't been mentioned yet are extra<br/>
baggies to replace ones in a letterbox that have holes in them, a<br/>
compass, an printed map of the area (usually from one of the online map<br/>
sites), sunscreen &amp; a hat depending on how long you'll be out.  My wife<br/>
keeps nagging me to bring a 1st aid kit, especially after being stung by<br/>
a bee yesterday while boxing.  &amp; something that I should have brought<br/>
are extra logbooks since 2 of the boxes we found had full logbooks. <br/>
<br/>
A warning that you may have seen already about baby-type wipes, most of<br/>
them are scented in some way &amp; if you use them to clean a stamp, the<br/>
scent will remain &amp; may be attractive to animals that may dig the box<br/>
up.  It's usually recommended to only use water &amp; paper napkin to clean<br/>
the stamps so there's no residual scent on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Have fun &amp; be sure to ask any other questions you have,<br/>
