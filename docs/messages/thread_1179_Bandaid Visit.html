I know nothing about eating in S.F. Maybe if Bandaid is staying at the  <br/>
Renaissance Park, SHE can ask the concierge to suggest something (simple and  <br/>
nearby?) and he/she can make reservations for us. I'd vote for an early dinner  as <br/>
our travel time home is about 2 hours from there.<br/>

So may not be the best place for stamping books.  But, still highly recommend it for dinner some other time.<br/>

<br/>
I used to live in that part of town (the Tenderloin, aka the 'loin), and<br/>
one of my favorite restaurants over there is Naan N Curry, on Eddy at<br/>
Leavenworth:<br/>
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=398+eddy,+san+francisco,+ca&amp;om=1<br/>
<br/>
The food is Pakistani/Indian, very tasty, and very affordable.  It's a<br/>
spacious restaurant, and the noise level isn't deafening.  You order at<br/>
the counter, sit, and wait for your food to be brought to you.  Beverages<br/>
(other than lassis) and tableware are all self-serve, to help cut down on<br/>
price.  The menu can be seen here:<br/>
http://www.naanncurry.com/<br/>
(IIRC it is right on the corner at Leavenworth, so ignore the site's<br/>
mentioning of "Levenworth &amp; Jones".)<br/>
<br/>
Another good restaurant in that area is Golden Era Vegetarian Restaurant,<br/>
a Chinese/Vietnamese/Pan-Asian restaurant (run by Vietnamese devotees of a<br/>
Vietnamese Buddhist lama, if I recall correctly).  It's at O'Farrell and<br/>
Leavenworth.  The food is fantastic, and completely vegetarian/vegan; they<br/>
serve lots of fake meat dishes that are so close to the real thing you'll<br/>
be hard pressed to tell the difference.  This is more expensive than NNC<br/>
but again, the food is absolutely great.  Menus here:<br/>
http://www.goldeneravegetarian.com/<br/>
Map:<br/>
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=572+Ofarrell+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94102<br/>
<br/>
If it's Friday or Monday I can join you all - Saturday and Sunday I'll be<br/>
in Sac.<br/>
<br/>
If Indian or Asian won't work, let me know - I know of a number of other<br/>
good restaurants in that area.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
