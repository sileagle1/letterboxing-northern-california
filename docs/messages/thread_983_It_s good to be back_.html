activity I missed these past 6 weeks.  I am overwhelmed with the <br/>
amount of creative spark in the Bay area....who knew the SF skyline <br/>
woudl be so magnificent once rendered into jello?  <br/>
<br/>
Steve, Ben and I had an amazing time in New Zealand.  No snafus, <br/>
except for having to surrender Ben's Swiss Army knife (which did not <br/>
even have a blade, but a pair of scissors) at airport security on <br/>
our return trip.  It is a beautiful country, and lots of potential <br/>
for LBing, although the native flora does not lend itself to hiding <br/>
boxes as easily as or oak trees.  <br/>
<br/>
I only found 3 boxes while there....I had the potential for 4 other <br/>
boxes but I choked...drove right by one, not realizing it was there <br/>
until days later consulting the map realized we had already past <br/>
it.  Misplacing clues and couldn't find them for the town we were in <br/>
(My folder got stuck behind the chest of drawers in the campervan <br/>
for  awhile), The third box in Hokitiki we skipped since pouring <br/>
buckets of rain at the time and we were pre-occupied talking tothe <br/>
two Dutch hitchhikers we had picked up. And the last box I <br/>
attempted....the gates were locked!  Even though supposedly a 24/7 <br/>
kind of location.  Of course lotsa of other boxes in New Zealand <br/>
(though not many compared to here) but we either did not have the <br/>
time or where not going near enough to try to nab them.  <br/>
<br/>
I planted 4 boxes though, saw some incredible scenery, ate great <br/>
food (Green lipped mussels are yummy!), met wonderful people and <br/>
even caught a rainbow trout!  Steve caught over a dozen (And we we <br/>
released them all to live another day).  Expect to see some New <br/>
Zealand inspired boxes out of me this wnter and spring.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking foward to finding all the wonderful new boxes (and those not <br/>
so new but that I have not had time for yet).  Adn looking foward to <br/>
the creative thought workshop led by Paul.  Should we ask for a <br/>
guest appearance/performance of the TRaveling Circus stamps?  <br/>
