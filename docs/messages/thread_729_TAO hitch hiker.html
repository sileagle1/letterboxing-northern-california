                    <div class="plaintext-content">The TAO hitch hiker isn't listed with Pete and Wanda, or any of <br/>
the other places I could think of.  I can't imagine that the original <br/>
planters would mind if I gave the stamp a new book, and sent it <br/>
back out on the road...  But I really would like to check in before I <br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
We dropped an email right away to Linda, who planted the box in <br/>
question.  Never heard anything back.  <br/>
<br/>
I figured that removing the offending page would be a fairly <br/>
in-offensive action.  If someone gets upset with me for this, I <br/>
would have some serious thinking to do...   <br/>
