<br/>
Clan Jiggs just wanted to publicly give a great big "Thank You" to <br/>
the organizers of this event! We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!<br/>
It was great to meet up with some familiar faces (Sir B, Sierra <br/>
Sally, Ryan to name but a few) and to put some faces to familiar <br/>
names (Lizardbutt's Family, Letterboxspectors)and finally to meet <br/>
some of the "newbies" - remember, in this game, you're only a newbie <br/>
as long as you wanna be!!)<br/>
<br/>
Although we were only able to pick up 4 boxes due to time <br/>
constraints, (It STILL took us almost 3 1/2 hours to drive the 90 Mi <br/>
back to Yuba City!!)  it has now given us incentive to one day <br/>
return to the Bay Area (we're moving back to Canada next Saturday).<br/>

seeing old as well as new faces, and finally meeting Ryan. We only <br/>
hit two boxes yesterday because it was Jetlag's birthday and we had <br/>
to head out early to celebrate with family. Thank you Old Blue for <br/>
carving the beautiful event stamp, and Princess Lea for setting up <br/>
the event.<br/>
