That's interesting that you say that LB is easier as I have the <br/>
impression that Geocaching is easier - but that may be because the ones <br/>
you have searched for are the most accessible.  I guess the reason that <br/>
Geocaching does not appeal to me is that it relies too much on <br/>
technology.  I like the creative aspects of letterboxing.  Although the <br/>
hunting part is lots of fun to me, but reward of finding the stamp and <br/>
the joy of seeing that it is hand carved is the most important aspect <br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that there are lots more geocachers out there - <br/>
don't know if that's because it is more widely marketed as a hobby or <br/>
what.  While there are definitely dumb people in both the world of <br/>
geocaching and letterboxing who will not understand the importance of <br/>
rehiding well and being discreet and sensitive to the natural world, <br/>
the sheer numbers of geocachers mean that they are going to have more <br/>
of an impact.  I think that's why we hear more stories about them.  I <br/>
have met some geocachers who were very cool and creative also, and have <br/>
even brought a couple over to the LB side.  Don and Michelle, can you <br/>
tell us if there is a community in the geocaching world like ours here <br/>
on LbNCA?  Or is everyone out there just sort of doing it on their own? <br/>
  Sorry I don't know too much about that aspect.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Black Cavalier - <br/>
<br/>
We do both caching and letterboxing and its fabulous to mix the two! <br/>
The rest of our extended family are mainly cachers even though I <br/>
have carved them all stamps so they can do both as well.<br/>
<br/>
Just like we've discovered many a wonderful place while boxing, the <br/>
same is true for caching.<br/>
<br/>
We print out clues for both caches AND boxes when we head somewhere -<br/>
 like this Saturday we were in Davis and we got 2 caches and 1 <br/>
letterbox (and one attempted but not found box) and a tasty lunch. <br/>
It was such a lovely afternoon and one of the caches was along this <br/>
beautiful walkway by a river going through the UCD campus. I had no <br/>
idea such a wonderful place to walk was there! It was a great walk <br/>
and a fun hide.<br/>
<br/>
Both caches and boxes can each be difficult to find (requiring <br/>
skill) - if the clues on each, as well as the placer, is clever and <br/>
creative! (I've seen poor versions of both.)<br/>
<br/>
Try it sometime! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
