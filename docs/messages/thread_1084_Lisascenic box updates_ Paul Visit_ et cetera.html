                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow....What a nice way of thinking of us (and still getting in some<br>
letterboxing)!<br>
<br>
Did you get the Brundibar part of the Berkeley Rep letterboxes?  There<br>
is more than one "box" in that jungle...  Nine Parts of Desire is out<br>
of commission for the time being.  I'm just too busy to get more<br>
(undisclosed art objects) in place.<br>
<br>
What did you think of the recycled letterbox?<br>
<br>
Did you know that you were within a stone's throw of Robb's Lake<br>
Merritt  boxes?  He has a new location and new stamp for the one that<br>
went missing.  Same general image as the Cormorant Mystery Box, but --<br>
we think -- better carving.<br>
<br>
*********************************************<br>
<br>
Robb was just about to start physical therapy yesterday when a<br>
three-foot-tall balloon sculpture of The Roadrunner bounced into the<br>
room.  The multi-talented Paul had come for a visit!  I wonder if you<br>
all know that he does gigantic balloon sculpture, in addition to all<br>
of his other creations?  The therapist was a bit short-handed, so Paul<br>
actually participated in walking with Robb.<br>
<br>
********************************************<br>
<br>
I'm sad to say that I have several boxes carved and ready to go that<br>
are "marinating" in my living room.  But, just wait until Robb is back<br>
up and about, and be ready for a letterboxing explosion.  <br>
<br>
Robb hasn't got the energy to carve anything yet.  And he probably<br>
doesn't want a bed full of pink schnibbles, either.  Once he's more<br>
mobile, I expect that he may have some creative energy that needs to<br>
be expressed!<br>
<br>
Thanks, again, everyone for your kind wishes!<br>

I want a three-foot-tall balloon sculpture of The Roadrunner.<br>
*sniffle* Please tell me I don't have to break my back to acquire one<br>
of those, though!<br>
<br>
Just kidding. But that is pretty cool. =) I didn't know Paul did<br>
gigantic balloon sculpture. Are there pictures where we can see more?<br>
Are there? Are there?<br>

 <br>
No, we didn't. Frankly, the area had some pretty  disgusting 'items' in it <br>
and we weren't ton interested in spending a lot of time  hunting. Once we found <br>
the 2 tins, we were happy. A question: are we to count  these as one box or <br>
more? We always figure hunting and finding a box counts as  one find. If the box <br>
is moved or the stamp is put in a new location, we can  count it again. But <br>
if we already know where it is, that's just one find. When  we posted our finds <br>
yesterday to Atlasquest, I think it counted as 2 finds. Your  thoughts?<br>
<br>
<br>
What  did you think of the recycled letterbox?<br>
 <br>
Your clues were masterfull! Only took us a few  seconds to find it as we came <br>
upon it from the correct direction and I could see  the box before we got <br>
there.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes we did. Even had the clues with us but ran  out of time. Old Blue had to <br>
visit his elderly parents before it got too late.  We also had the clues for <br>
your Berkeley mystery box but I wrote down the wrong  address and couldn't find <br>
it. However, we did come upon the Berkeley Farmer's  Market which was cool!<br>
 <br>
Keep up the wonderful work--with the boxes AND  Robb!!  <br>

Oh, I didn't realize there was an official letterboxing term for the<br>
