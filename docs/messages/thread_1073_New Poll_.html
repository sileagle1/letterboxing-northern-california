When picking a date for the second session of the Creative Thinking <br/>
workshop, please use Saturdays only, and avoid the last week of March, <br/>
when I'll be in NYC. Thanks!<br/>

I'm glad I apologized nicely to the woman working at Crissy Field <br/>
Center who was upset at us for moving the upholstered chairs. I told <br/>
her I had talked to the office staff and got their approval. By the <br/>
time we left, she was smiling as I thanked her for the 30th time for <br/>
being so understanding. I picked Crissy Field because parking was easy.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the Tabula Rasa book yesterday. It's now acquired a <br/>
mysterious power &amp; presence, with 11 stamped, sealed envelopes holding <br/>
dream ambitions in secret.<br/>
