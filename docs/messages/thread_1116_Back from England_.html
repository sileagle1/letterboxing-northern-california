                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well we are finally back - yesterday was a brutal day of travel and I <br>
got in about midnight, feeling quite fried.  I am forseeing a nap this <br>
afternoon!  By crazy coincidence Amanda and Ryan ended up being on my <br>
flight from London to Philly - they'd been trying for a week to get on <br>
a flight (stand by) and they finally succeeded.<br>
<br>
We have lots to tell and Ryan is working on his Great Adventures with <br>
all the gruesome details, but for a quick synopsis of the Dartmoor part <br>
of the trip:<br>
<br>
-- we did find our 100 boxes to merit the "patch" and inclusion in the <br>
Dartmoor 100 Club (I think our final count was somewhere around 140 - <br>
the weather was really terrible, otherwise I'm sure we would have found <br>
more)<br>
<br>
-- we did make it out to Cranmere Pool - some other hikers were there <br>
that day (not letterboxers) and they were impressed that Americans had <br>
managed to find it all by themselves (I guess many Brits have <br>
difficulty finding this location).  There was snow on the ground but at <br>
least the skies were clear<br>
<br>
-- we did meet God!  At the gathering on March 26, we had the privilege <br>
to talk to Godfrey Swinscow, the unofficial president of the Dartmoor <br>
100 club that doesn't really exist.  <br>
<br>
They play this game very differently in England, and I have to say, now <br>
that everything's said and done, I prefer our way better.  The whole <br>
artistic element of LbNA is missing over there - virtually nothing <br>
there is hand carved.  Many of the stamps are commissioned at shops, so <br>
at least they are personalized, but the designs are fairly boring.  <br>
About half the boxes we found were store bought, generic images that <br>
some kid put out there, so on that front we were pretty disappointed in <br>
the quality.  It was fun in a way to just wander around on a tor <br>
looking under various rocks to see if there was a box - we had very <br>
little luck in finding boxes using the triangulation coordinates <br>
provided in the Dartmoor clues.  Occasionally we would figure it out, <br>
but the box would be missing.  We did much better simply scrounging in <br>
likely places.  We did eventually acquire "box vision" where you could <br>
tell from 100 paces whether there was going to be a box under a <br>
suspicious pile of rocks.<br>
<br>
We went to a "pre-gathering" at the Railway Inn the night before the <br>
big Clocks Changing event, and that was way more fun than the actual <br>
event itself, which can be described better as a zoo than an event.  <br>
But at the pre-gathering at least you could sit and chat with people.  <br>
However, many attendees were only interested in getting stamp images <br>
(didn't matter how crappy they were) and very few ever even mentioned <br>
their trail names, so we don't even know who we met.  They do not <br>
exchange personal stamp images like we do - you get their "traveller" <br>
instead, and many people have several travellers.  We did manage to get <br>
to know a few nice folks, and Ryan was able to promote his Atlas Quest <br>
site (although I'm not entirely sure if they grasped the concept - it <br>
was a fairly low tech kind of crowd).  We were a bit of a novelty, <br>
being the Americans - most of them did not even realize that <br>
letterboxing has taken off over here.  Also we found out that there are <br>
other hotbeds of letterboxing within the UK, but it is still a mostly <br>
WOM activity.  I think one person said there are about 1,000 boxes in <br>
the New Forest, which is a national park in the south-central part of <br>
England.  It would be cool if some of those clues could eventually make <br>
it onto Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
We did our part to plant boxes there too.  I think I put out 5 on <br>
Dartmoor, and then another 6 or 7 in other parts of England (mostly in <br>
Cornwall).  Gotta work on those clues, although I doubt they'll get <br>
much traffic.<br>
<br>
So what's going on with the Sonoma mini meet & greet?  I can bring <br>
pictures and logbooks from Dartmoor to it if anyone wants to see them <br>
(I get the feeling DSaj is frothing at the mouth at this prospect!).  <br>
Glad everything seems to be okay here on this list!<br>

So true, Lea!! And Old Blue too! Can't wait to hear the details of your  trip <br>
and see those 'crappy stamps' in your log book. You should have plenty of  <br>
time to catch up on your sleep by the time we meet again. <br>
 <br>
Although we did get out to 'box a little when you were gone, I predict we  <br>
will never be neck-and-neck with your F-count again, even though we plan to be  <br>
in the Manchester, CT area in the fall. :<(<br>
 <br>
I've heard nothing about the Sonoma meet and greet lately. Forgot when it  <br>
is, actually. Someone refresh my memory.<br>
 <br>
C.U. soon.<br>
