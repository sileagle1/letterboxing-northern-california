Mendocino: There is a paved bike trail called the fern trail. about<br>
4.5 miles total<br>
<br>
Sacramento, east to Folsom: there is the American River bike trail.<br>
The weather might be kind of hot, but I really like this bike trail.<br>
It's especially nice along Lake Natoma.<br>
<br>
Morgan Hill: the coyote creek trail is 17 miles RT from Lake Anderson<br>
up to Hellyer Park in San Jose.<br>

The Nevada County Fair starts tomorrow and goes thru Sunday It is in<br>
Nevada City/Grass Valley, maybe 2 to 3 hours from Oakland. I think there<br>
are several letterboxes around, it is beautiful country. This fair is in<br>
the pines with good accessibility and almost all of the food is provided<br>
by clubs and organizations who use the fair as fund raisers. So its<br>
really good food for a good purpose. This is your old time country fair<br>
it used to cost 25cents to get in, I think its more now.   Pirates of<br>
the barnyard is the theme this year. You can check out the schedule<br>
online at http://www.nevadacountyfair.com/pdf/2007%20Fair%20Schedule.pdf<br>
or http://www.nevadacountyfair.com/fair/<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
On Sat they have about 80 events listed from Rabbit and Chicken costume<br>
contest to Clogging, to a treasure hunt, to silkwork demo, wool spinning<br>
demo, needlework and quilting demos. If you cant find something at this<br>
fair to be interested in, you are hurtin for certain.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I usually go, but I have a retirement dinner in Visalia. Its the BEST<br>
county fair. <br>
<br>
Just my suggestion.  Wish I was going if you do go, check out the Red<br>
Barn and buy a ticket from my Mom to win  a beef or a beautiful<br>
handmade quilt with flying geese on it. The funds go for scholarships,<br>
which I received when I was in college. <br>
