I didn't mean to come off snippy or anything.  We plan on going to benicia to start off but this series sounded like fun.  Ok I am off now to try to change my deiselluver to my Geo name which is part of my stamp, so I am trying to figure out how to do it.  LOL.  I am really embarrassed about this but Thanks so much for the quick response.  I definetly want to do this series so look for my stamp soon.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well since I directed you to find LBNCA, I guess I should try to get you to the spot where you can find a lot of info on your own. Most of your questions will be answered by the FAQS page or you can post your questions on the Newboxers list. You should go to LBNA home page www.letterboxing.org/ and click on FAQS or you can click on the book, then map, then state, then area. Peruse the areas you wish to search. If you are looking for a specific LB(letterbox) click on "Search for boxes" and type in "Alien" and that will bring up any LB with Alien in the title. Your original post to the Newboxers list gave me the impression that you had already found the home page and knew where to locate clues for letterboxes. Obviously that is not the case, and you should probably spend some time cruising through the various information sources. The LBNCA list is set up for chat between letterboxers interested in the northern California area,and the Newboxers list is set up for questions/answers from new letterboxers. You will find there are many regional chat lists and you can find out where they are along with more info on Silent Doug's web site www.letterboxing.info/ or you can go to Ryan's web site www.atlasquest.com/ and look through their tutorials.<br>
