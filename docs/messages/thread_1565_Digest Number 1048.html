                          Tip for reducing smearing of tranferred images                Posted by:      "Paul"             pgonyea@earthlink.net                                          paulonthepark                                 Mon Jul 2, 2007 7:56 am        (PST)                       While working on #4 of my Cabinet of Curiosities boxes, I tried <br/>
 something new. I use the tissue paper transfer method to get my images <br/>
 onto carving material. After getting a pencil image, I usually use a <br/>
 fine point Sharpie to darken and sharpen the transfer image. BUT, I <br/>
 always end up smearing the image while working (both the Sharpie ink &amp; <br/>
 the pencil smear). <br/>
<br/>
 This time, I sprayed my tranferred image with workable fixative, which <br/>
 I spray lightly on my pastel paintings to "set" the pigment powder in <br/>
 place. For this purpose, I used a heavier coat on the stamp material. <br/>
 I found that it helped a lot. Smearing was reduced greatly, but not <br/>
 totally eliminated. <br/>
<br/>
 I'll bet that hair spray would act the same way, though (and it's less <br/>
 expensive than workable fixative). With hair spray, I'd keep it light <br/>

 I understand that, for sure. When I finish a pastel painting, it gets <br/>
 a very, very light amount of fixative, because I don't like what it <br/>
 does to the appearance of the pigment.<br/>
<br/>
 Doesn't ball point smear, too? Maybe India ink is an answer...<br/>

&gt; When do you move? I'll be in NY from July 16 - 25. I hear there are <br/>
&gt; so many boxes in CT, that you'll stub your toe on one every time you <br/>
&gt; take a walk!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I see that LbNY is now up to 127 members from the 10 I started with!<br/>

I move there on Labor Day weekend. So we have plenty of time to box<br/>
together when you are home. Weeeee!! It will be so good to see you!<br/>
<br/>
Yep..your LBCNY has become a nice group now. Many cool carvers here in<br/>
good ol' Upstate NY too, so I am sure you will enjoy your stay. <br/>
