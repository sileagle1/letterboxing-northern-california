                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those of you who didn't catch it on TV, Bay Area Backroads did a <br/>
feature on geocaching that was centered on the caches in San <br/>
Francisco. It was quite a bit of coverage &amp; a good explanation of <br/>
geocaching. I wonder if there'll be a spike in the number of Bay Area <br/>
geocachers - or - if they might be subject to some vandalizing. (I <br/>
gritted my teeth when they showed the geocache at a certain location <br/>
where a certain letterbox called Nepenthe once resided. No bitterness <br/>
here).<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, I found a box planted by our familiar LbNCA <br/>
friend, Amanda from Seattle -- approx. 3,000 miles away in Key West! <br/>
However, I was unable to locate a nearby box planted by one of our <br/>
group's moderators, Ryan. I know I was close, but I gave up because <br/>
the mid-day heat was melting me and a swim in the ocean was calling my <br/>
name. Mission aborted. I was in Key West visiting my best friend, Sue, <br/>
who, when visiting me in SF, helped me look for "Where Buffalos Roam", <br/>
placed by Amanda's friend, Princess Lea. All connected somehow...   <br/>

here in the Northwest. Looks like all of those "Backroad shows" are<br/>
getting a geocaching piece. They even interviewed the guy who runs the<br/>
geocaching website so if I see him on the trail, I'll know who he is. ;o)<br/>
