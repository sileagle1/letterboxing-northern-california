It would be a good idea if you would read Jay Drew's last post at <br/>
this site before you start at the beginning. While some of these <br/>
letterboxes may or may not be lost and forgotten, some have been <br/>
adopted and are still listed at LBNA. I believe Painted Caves may <br/>
still be alive in San Diego area, but I haven't confirmed it. It is <br/>
a nice hike if anyone from that area is interested. Most of the <br/>
California letterboxes that are listed are listed very early , so <br/>
you will be able to locate the listings quite easily. Dumster Diving?<br/>

them (Donner, Auburn, Davis) have been moved to the Big List already.  <br/>
I'm going to ask Jay the best way to note that they are have been taken <br/>
care of (removed from the basement and brought "upstairs"?)  I also <br/>
have a lofty ambition of trying to revive some of the "lost" boxes from <br/>
the early days, such as the ones in Byxbee Park in Palo Alto.  I have <br/>
some of the original images and would like to replant them.  Someday. <br/>
When I don't have 90,000 things to do.  Like in the year 2020.  Maybe I <br/>
should attend to replacing my own missing boxes first.  Sigh.<br/>
