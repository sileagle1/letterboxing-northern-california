sound harder and less cool than it is.  Like say that all stamps are on ten<br/>
mile hikes, etc.  And be really mean in the interview, too.  Maybe somebody<br/>
should set up a fake letterboxing site that all the press people are<br/>
directed too... Or just  do like Black Cavalier said and be polite but<br/>
stern.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got an inquiry from Bonedoc over the weekend that she had been<br/>
contacted as well, and she was wondering if I might show up and do a<br/>
carving demo, and asked for my thoughts. I told her most of us might<br/>
prefer no story, but if they were going to do it anyway, to REALLY<br/>
emphasize knowing the protocol before going out. To keep it a secret<br/>
(on tv...hah!), be stealthy, take care of boxes &amp; locations. These are<br/>
all things she knows (and feels, her Jungle Inn box went missing :( )<br/>
I do think we are going to have to start taking precautions about<br/>
protecting the boxes we most care about (hmmm, box prophylactics...<br/>
stealth tactics... misleading fact-ics...): making the clues harder (I<br/>
haven't checked out the F factor yet, is it a reality?), making the<br/>
clues themselves harder to find, maybe more wom so the clues only get<br/>
passed on to worthy (and known) recipients. Be as nice as we can to<br/>
all newbies, while emphasizing the responsibilties inherent in being<br/>
part of the "club".<br/>
<br/>
On a sad note, Milk Farm is indeed gone, and I have put it on the "to<br/>
be re-planted" list, for as soon as I can get to carving it. It has<br/>
been so popular, and the stories and memories many people have shared<br/>
make me sad to lose the logbook on this one. So we'll start over.<br/>
<br/>
fyi: I revised the clues for Wine Goddess to make her a little more<br/>
accessible (she's lonely...has only had two visitors), so if you're<br/>
headed to Sonoma County (mustard is in bloom!) check out the new clues.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Maui was wonderful...the whales were very active the first few<br/>
days; we enjoyed all the other good stuff as well. My mom (Healdsburg<br/>
Amadeus, aka Julia, whom some of you have met) loved it all...it was<br/>
her first time, and I did think we were going to have to leave her in<br/>
Hana and have her stuff shipped over.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone soon (gotta get my act together!)<br/>

Kathy of Team Tysonosaurus, Wassamatta_U and I went out with the <br/>
camera crew from Bay Area Backroads yesterday.  Bonedoc had filemd <br/>
with them a few weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
You can read all about this odd experience at Robb's blog.<br/>

I believe that this is going to be a good segment on letterboxing.  We <br/>
only sought our own boxes, but nevertheless folks might want to <br/>
consider upping find-count requirements.<br/>
<br/>
See you this weekend!<br/>
