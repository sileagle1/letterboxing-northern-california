                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think I've mentioned that I spend every summer painting <br>
scenery for an opera company in Cooperstown, New York.  I've <br>
been happily carving stamps with the notion of stashing them in <br>
all of my favorite places.   <br>
<br>
I just finished a large stamp in honor of the amazing artists at <br>
Adelphi Paperhanging (which despite what the website says, <br>
has its studio in a tiny town called Sharon Springs NY).  Adelphi <br>
is the Holy Grail of relief printing. They hand print period <br>
reproduction wallpaper with wooden blocks. <br>
<br>
http://www.adelphipaperhangings.com/unique.html<br>
<br>
I have been torturing myself a bit, because there don't seem to <br>
be any active letterboxers near me. Near is a pretty relative term, <br>
as this is a very rural area.   I want to invite you all over to my<br>
house to see this baby before I send my stamp out into the wild <br>
world.<br>
<br>
And while I'm torturing myself, can someone advise me on how <br>
well Speedy Stamp holds up to very, very cold weather.  Weeks <br>
on end in the single digits?  I'm thinking of asking the folks at <br>
Adelphi to keep an eye on the stamp, but I don't want to be a <br>
burden on them, by making this a stamp that you ask a business <br>
owner about.  The studio has a big store-front window, and they <br>
allow gawkers, but are not open for tours.<br>
<br>
Thanks for putting up with my excessive zealousness.  <br>

I have done some boxing in Vermont where it can get down to 35 below <br>
zero.  I was AMAZED at how well the stamps held up, and even the crummy <br>
GladWare containers were okay.  Last summer I found some stamps that <br>
had been hidden in 1998 and they were as good as new.  Problems arise <br>
more from infiltrating water than the cold - in fact, I'd say the cold <br>
may even preserve the box!  The Speedy Stamp is the pink stuff, right?  <br>
That stuff is indestructible.<br>

Sierra Sally was going to send me an e-mail with the group photos to<br>
put up, but I haven't gotten it yet.  She's probably still recovering<br>
from the event, though. ;o)<br>
<br>
There is a Photos section if you use the web version of these Yahoo<br>
Groups that anyone can upload their photos of the event. The GRR<br>
folder is empty as of this minute, but everyone is welcome to start<br>
uploading their pictures if they want. If you have trouble figuring<br>
out how to use it, you can also e-mail me the pictures and I'll put<br>
them up for you.<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>
