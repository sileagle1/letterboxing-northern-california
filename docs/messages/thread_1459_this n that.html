The story about the long-dormant cootie brings up a question:<br>
<br>
What does one do with extra-large hitch hikers?  It seems that all the<br>
letterboxes we've found recently were too small to fit this one hitch<br>
hiker that we've been dragging around for months.  Considering the<br>
rainy weather, I'm hesitant to just set it out, in ziplock bags.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I should just mail it to an unsuspecting friend.....?<br>

I know of a few CAVERNOUS letterboxes nearby and would be happy to make<br>
a transfer and plant it for you.  Or if you want to join me for a hike,<br>
we can drop it off together.  Perhaps we can leave the men down at the<br>
house to compare bikes?  My hubby is out on his road bike now and would<br>
undoubtedly be mesmerized by Robb's new wheels. <br>
<br>
I'm curious now--I thought I was the only one with 4"x3" stamps!  Mine<br>
are mounted on wood blocks, so they are enormous!  Does limit the<br>
placement a bit, but I just can't squeeze the detail I want into a<br>
smaller piece...<br>
<br>
If you are interested in any of the above, give me a holler offline.  <br>

(In town this weekend, down to San Simeon next weekend--we're driving<br>
the PCH home to hit some new letterboxes in Gordo!!)<br>
