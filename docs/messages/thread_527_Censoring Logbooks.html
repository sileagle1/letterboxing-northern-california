Hi, <br>
  I made the rounds of the Folsom Kids' Park boxes today & the books <br>
had what I felt were inappropriate messages in them.  Based on the <br>
handwritting, it looked like a junior high aged kid "stamped" in & <br>
wrote unpleasant & derogatory things about someone they knew.  They <br>
also wrote rude comments on other pages where people had already <br>
stamped.  I thought about removing the kid's page, but didn't since I <br>
wasn't sure what the protocol would be in a case like this.  <br>
Unfortunately, even if I did, the some of the previous pages would <br>
still have the kid's comments.  What would you suggest at this <br>
point?  I can send an email to the planter of the boxes, but I think <br>
I've done that before about other things & they haven't responded.  <br>
<br>
Also, I'm worried that the kid will deface other boxes in the area.  <br>
I'm pretty sure they had the clues to the boxes since I found <br>
thier "stamps" in 2 different books, & they probably wouldn't have <br>
stumbled across both of them.  <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, in geocaching, what we do is send an email to the owner of the<br>
cache to let them know that there's defacement of the logbook so they<br>
can go replace it (but usually defacers will also trash the cache, the<br>
surrounding area if they can get away with it, and steal stuff). Then<br>
we alert other cache owners in the area to be wary. If all else fails,<br>
we contact Groundspeak and ask them to yank the kid's membership.<br>
<br>
Usually, they get bored and go away after a few tries. If things<br>
escalate, you can see if there's a pattern or if you can ID the kid<br>
and contact their school or parents to deal with them.<br>
