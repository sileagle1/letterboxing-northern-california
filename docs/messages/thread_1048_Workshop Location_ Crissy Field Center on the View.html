                    <div class="plaintext-content">This building is right on Crissy Field, just past the Marina, and is <br/>
part of the Presidio. It's a glass-front building (#603) and is well-<br/>
marked by signage.<br/>
<br/>
Accessible by MUNI buses #28, alternate buses on the #29 line (ask <br/>
driver), and the #30, #43, and #45 all pass nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Driving from SF, East Bay, points south: <br/>
Go north on Van Ness, left on Bay St., right on Laguna to Marina Blvd.,<br/>
go past Marina Green, bear slightly right into Presidio on Mason St. <br/>
Watch for signs.<br/>
