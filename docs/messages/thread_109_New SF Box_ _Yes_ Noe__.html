                    <div class="plaintext-content">After returning from a weekend in Long Beach and getting my first 5 <br/>
finds, I was charged up to plant my second letterbox. It's a tribute <br/>
to Noe Street in my neighborhood, Duboce Triangle. It has lots of <br/>
container gardens lovingly placed and maintained by residents.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are a trail of (distorted) photos [EVIL GRIN] of garden <br/>
details. Perfect for this time of the year. Much simpler to solve <br/>
than my Vertigo #1 box, but the joy is in the journey, right? <br/>
<br/>
This afternoon, my neighbors' girls, ages 7 &amp; 9, are doing a test of <br/>
my photo clues. So if they succeed, you'll have no excuse for not <br/>
getting this one!<br/>
<br/>
If you don't know this section of Noe Street, hunt for this box, <br/>
enjoy a lovely garden street, and try to beat Princess Lea to First <br/>
Finder status. <br/>
<br/>
I've been actively marketing letterboxing to friends &amp; co-workers, <br/>
so you may start to see more action in SF. I think San Francisco <br/>
should give San Luis Obispo some competition for being a high <br/>
letterbox zone! I'm working on it!<br/>

Too late!  Got there today, but I left the First Finder gift for the <br/>
next person, since I had already gotten the First Finder bonus at the <br/>
Vertigo #1 box.  It was a postcard with a piece of gold paper around it <br/>
and at first I thought I'd won a trip to the Wonka Chocolate Factory!  <br/>
The Vertigo box will indeed make you dizzy.  The box is somewhat large <br/>
and will require the utmost discretion on the finder's part - I took <br/>
everything with me into the bathroom that is on site and hid in there <br/>
so no one could see what I was up to when stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
Both boxes were great fun - just the right blend of trickiness and <br/>
findability.  I am also very impressed with the results Paul gets from <br/>
working with an Exacto knife - I cannot control those things at all.  I <br/>
nominate Paul in SF for Rookie of the Year!<br/>
