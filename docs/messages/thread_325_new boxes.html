                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hurray! Hurray! We just returned from this hike, and we loved the whole<br>
experience! Truly lovely hike and stamps, and wonderful hiding spots. We<br>
forgot to bring colors, unfortunately, so just had our three-color stamping<br>
pad - a poor substitute.<br>
<br>
We were the first at this one, found Blackbird's HH and hid one we had found<br>
at Fairy Ring (also planted by Blackbird, and also very sweet).<br>
<br>
Do pay attention to the well-written clues. At one point we thought<br>
Blackbird had made a mistake in identifying the material something was made<br>
of, and scrambled up a difficult non-path for no reason whatsoever....<br>
<br>
Also, we picked up the regular trail map instead of the self-guided tour -<br>
both are in the same map box, so pay attention to this, too.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much, Blackbird! We can't wait for more (any coming???!). And<br>
we got re-inspired to create another series for the East Bay. Hopefully<br>
soon.<br>

Wow, when looking thru the new boxes at the LBNA site, I <br>
think...Connecticut must be absolutely STUFFED with boxes!  <br>
And it's a tiny (relatively) state!<br>
