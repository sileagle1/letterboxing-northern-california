WORLD PREMIERE<br/>
about the show<br/>
The world premiere of Passing Strange takes musical theatre on a <br/>
whole new trip. It's the heartfelt and hilarious story of a young <br/>
bohemian who charts a course for "the real" through sex, drugs and <br/>
rock and roll. Loaded with soulful lyrics and overflowing with <br/>
passion, the show takes us from black, middle-class America to <br/>
Amsterdam, Berlin and beyond on a journey towards personal and <br/>
artistic authenticity.<br/>
<br/>
the buzz<br/>
"Music this smart and tart, fussy and funny, will never hit the <br/>
mainstream."Village Voice<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps the finest collection of songs an American songwriter has <br/>
come up with this year."New York Times<br/>
<br/>
"To simply call him an artist is understatementwith every brush <br/>
stroke of music, Stew creates an indelible image in our minds."All <br/>
Music Guide<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, he's good! We named Stew's last two LPs Albums of the Year; <br/>
how many times must you be told?"Entertainment Weekly<br/>
<br/>

Stew is Entertainment Weekly's two-time artist of the year. The <br/>
Village Voice says his unique sound, dubbed Afro-Baroque cabaret, <br/>
is "smart and tart, fussy and funny," while the LA Times describes <br/>

times hilarious."<br/>
