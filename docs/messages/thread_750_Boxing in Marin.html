Gary of Da Kool Kats had a meeting in San Quentin yesterday so I rode<br/>
along in hopes that we could do some boxing in the area.  I had<br/>
several picked out so that we could get the most images for our<br/>
efforts within a short driving distance.  His meeting lasted longer<br/>
than expected so we were off to a late start.  We started with Walk 4<br/>
Marfan (4 stamps).  It was a much longer hike than we expected, so we<br/>
didn't attempt any others or we would be doing night boxing in the<br/>
woods, again, although we did have a flashlight with us. smile  As it<br/>
was, we didn't get home until 10:30 last night after stopping off to<br/>
pick up artTrekkers MILK FARM in the dark.  If you're in the area, put<br/>
this one on your "must get" list.<br/>
<br/>
I also highly recommend the area and hike of the Walk 4 Marfan.  It is<br/>
moderately strenuous with lots of ups and down hills and up and down<br/>
stairs in a beautiful setting.  I would guess about 3 miles total<br/>
walk/hike, but we're out of shape and a mile can seem like 2 to us, so<br/>
can't say for sure.  It is in mostly shade.  Box #2 is close to a<br/>
precarious little ledge that didn't leave a lot of room for us 2 "big<br/>
guys".  And, the Marin County winds were threating to throw me into<br/>
the brink.  Other than that warning, I suggest you add this one to<br/>
your must do list, as well.  It does not cost $7.00 as the clue<br/>
suggests.  It is only $2.00 to park, but there are about 4 parking<br/>
spaces right out the gate, no more than 50 feet from the original<br/>
starting point that is free.  It is a very "heart healthy" walk in a<br/>
beautiful setting.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like Markleeville is becoming a "hot bed" for boxing.  Thanks to<br/>
all who have placed boxes.  We may be up that way next weekend.  My<br/>
son and grandson are going to bike the Tahoe Rim Trail.  Hope to<br/>
squeeze in some box time with my daughter-in-law, Yacky Jackie of the<br/>
mtnbikemann's.  Will post if we do.<br/>
<br/>
So far this summer, we have not been boxing as much as we had hoped. <br/>
Adding these 5 images yesterday, brings our F count to 215.<br/>
<br/>
Keep Boxing,<br/>
