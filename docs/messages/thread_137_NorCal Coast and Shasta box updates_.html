<br/>
3/4 (Mrs Jiggs still recuperating) spent a wonderful couple of days <br/>
exploring the coast and north regions, managing to pick up 9 of 11 <br/>
attempted boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the breakdown..<br/>
<br/>
Gift in the Redwoods (Doublesaj/Old Blue) Ft Bragg - awesome, if <br/>
lonely stamp tucked away in a seldom seen redwood grove! We saw one <br/>
other car the whole time we were there!<br/>
<br/>
St Patrick's Series - Ft Bragg area great hand-carved stamps in a <br/>
breathtaking, scenic area!<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 The Shield - box in great condition in  a super spot for <br/>
families! The only problem I had was gvetting the kids to pick up <br/>
the box before tidepooling!!<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 4 Leaf Clover - another great box in an awesome spot! Just <br/>
don't forget your compass in the car, as all was not as it first <br/>
appeared!!!<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 The Brendan - kids loved both the box and the working <br/>
lighthouse! What a treat!<br/>
<br/>
Box #4 Faithful Donkey - short, spectacular hike along some of the <br/>
most incredible CA coastal scenery! ( and the Park Ranger let us i <br/>
for free too!!)<br/>
<br/>
Box #5 The Monk - he must be off spreading the "Good Word", for <br/>
alas, he was nowhere to be found! All was not lost though, as the <br/>
kids found and "adopted" a banana slug, and we stumbled accross a <br/>
nearby geocache (hmm, I wonder?!!).<br/>
<br/>
Todaqy we travelled north of Mt Shasta to pick up a few more boxes <br/>
in this area<br/>
<br/>
Pax - Funhog planted this box in one of the most riveting memorials <br/>
I've seen yet...we were fortunate enough to arrive as the annual <br/>
Memorial Day service was starting - gave me an opportunity to <br/>
explain some things to my kids (not the usual, "what did you do in <br/>
the war, daddy?" stuff)<br/>
<br/>
Mountain View - (Funhog) a nice, not too straight up the mountain <br/>
hike! Even my 6 y/o didn't mind the climb. Unfortunately, we didn't <br/>
find this one, but enjoyed the area. <br/>
<br/>
Tip of Shasta - (Doublesaj) a nice box just of I5, though we spent <br/>
an hour looking for the pavement to end!!! We also left a <br/>
little "something" for the next visitor!<br/>
<br/>
Packer's Bay (Dvn 2ckr) nice hike up to the overlook, however, the <br/>
poison oak is everywhere! Stay on the path, and you should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Dammed Shasta (Dvn 2ckr) absolutely awesome view of the dam and Mt <br/>
Shasta! This is one that should be seen in the afternoon on a clear <br/>
day! What a great way to end our weekend!<br/>
