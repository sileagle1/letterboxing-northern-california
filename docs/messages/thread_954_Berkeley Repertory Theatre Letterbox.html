days after I posted them!  Anna and Lea are losing their edge!<br/>
<br/>
However, if this sort of thing mattters to you, there is still the<br/>
opportunity to be First Finder, as I'm adding the third part of the<br/>
Berkeley Rep letterbox today. This part will be a rubber stamp based<br/>
in Maurice Sendak's illustrations for "Brundibar."<br/>
<br/>
For those of you, who haven't heard of this project, Berkeley<br/>
Repertory Theatre is presenting a double bill of the short operas<br/>
"Brundibar" and "The Comedy on the Bridge."  Both have newly<br/>
translated librettos by renowned playwright Tony Kushner, and scenery<br/>
and costumes by Maurice Sendak.<br/>
<br/>
"Brundibar" was originally composed in the ominous years leading up to<br/>
World War II and was performed by children imprisoned at Terezin, the<br/>
Nazi's notorious "model ghetto."  This short opera is a charming and<br/>
touching story about snall children standing up to cruel bullies.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you'll swing by and seek my multi-faceted Berkeley Rep letterbox.<br/>

unsavory!  It was clean when I hid it.  Oh well...If the Brundibar<br/>
rubber stamp is missing, then I had better re-think the location of<br/>
this  thing.  (Not that I really have time for this  right now...)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the joys of Urban Letterboxing.<br/>
