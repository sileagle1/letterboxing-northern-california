I often wondered if some of General Motors problems stem from their <br>
pushing their satellite communication system. There are some folks <br>
that don't want the tracking system. Their black box also retains <br>
information just prior to a collision. Big Brother and big business is <br>
watching, and there is very little that can be done.<br>
