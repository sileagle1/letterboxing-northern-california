&gt; I'll say it again - we really need for Lisa or Kel to teach us how <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; do that shading/texture thing! <br/>
<br/>
I wish I had the patience to carve shading! Most of my stamps have a <br/>
single subject image and I tend to get caught up in that image. I <br/>
think it is more of "what you see" before you start to carve. I have <br/>
done some shading on the subject itself, but forget background. <br/>
Maybe we should have Lisa or Kel post an image that looks like a <br/>
finished product, and several other images during the process. Then <br/>
we all try to reproduce it. Someone could be the recipiant of the <br/>
stamps and then find a place like the Hog Lake Plateau and do a <br/>
copycat caper.There might be some others around the country that <br/>
would want to participate. No I'm not volunteering.<br/>

You might write Andy in the UK, his trail name is The Happy Wanderer <br/>
and he is a member of this group? as well as other lists. You can <br/>
write me off list if you can't find his address and I can send it to <br/>
you. Another source would be to write Mel &amp; Ray at the Bowerland B&amp;B<br/>
(see letterbox clue list "Bowerland B&amp;B"). I would imagine that it <br/>
would be about as cold as northern Canada in March.<br/>
Don't go over with the expectations of finding bunches of <br/>
letterboxes on the Tors. You will have the opportunity to get plenty <br/>
of stamp images in the Pubs and other businesses, but the way clues <br/>
are set up on the Tors it is very difficult to find boxes in any <br/>
great number. Just seeing the area is well worth the trip.<br/>

It got a little boring. You couldn't use colored inks as everything <br/>
was coated in black ink residue. For a description of something I <br/>
found in a Scottish pub see Misc. Oddities board at AQ. It is called <br/>
the Buffalo Theory.<br/>
