&gt;the mtnbikemanns appear to be on fire! Thanks for<br/>
planting  all those new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you seen literal FIELDS of California<br/>
poppies? Breathtaking! We did a little tour to the<br/>
gold country yesterday, and in the little canyon south<br/>
of Jackson on 49, the hills are emerald green and<br/>
covered with glowing orange poppies. I got to be first<br/>
finder of Jumper's Reward and Gold Fever--both fun<br/>
locations and great stamps. Ironstone Winery is<br/>
surrounded by about a bazillion daffodils blooming<br/>
right now, and we saw wild turkeys on Sheep Ranch<br/>
Road, so it was truly a spring magical mystery tour.<br/>
Such a difference, too, from the piles of snow we<br/>
still have here in the mountains. The warm sun has<br/>
been shrinking them daily, and cross country skiing is<br/>
stellar right now, but it's great to visit actual<br/>
spring. So *many many thanks* to the mtnbikemanns for<br/>
planting in that area. I'm going to put it on my list,<br/>
too (maybe for relocating GRR boxes) because there are<br/>
so many great possiblities down there. Also, I left a<br/>
visitor in one of the boxes (actually, I put the box<br/>
in a bag &amp; the visitor, too--your logs are wonderful &amp;<br/>
so fat they leave little room for much else). <br/>
<br/>
&gt; P.S.  Regarding that virtual LB - I seem to be stuck<br/>
at the word find.  I'm fairly certain I have the right<br/>
answer, but the web site will not accept it.<br/>
<br/>
Lea, I'm stuck at Challenge #2--I've got the right<br/>
answer, but the page won't come up. Mim has been<br/>
feeding me clues, but I'm off it for now, too many<br/>
other things to do.<br/>

This is exactly the problem I am having.  I was wondering if maybe it <br/>
had something to do with the fact that I capitalized some of the words? <br/>
  Then, when I put it all in lower case, it doesn't accept it because it <br/>
is in my browser's history as "not found?"  Ryan, or any other techies <br/>
out there, what's up with this??<br/>

P.S.  to Mim - the link you sent me did work, so I am finally moving <br/>

Hmm...  I've never tried a virtual box before and haven't played<br/>
around with this one, but you are right that many website URLs are<br/>
case sensitive.  (Atlas Quest, for instance.)<br/>
<br/>
Most URLs try to use all lowercase--the defacto standard.  If that<br/>
doesn't work, try capitalizing the first letter of each word.  For<br/>
instance, instead of "messagenum" try "messageNum".  Or if it's the<br/>
name of a directory, try "MyStuff" instead of "mystuff".  And variations.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the URL in question you're working with so that may or<br/>
may not be the problem.  If your browser history isn't letting you<br/>
change the case sensitivity, you should be able to delete the<br/>
browser's history completely from "Options" under the "Tools" menu<br/>
item of your browser menu.<br/>
<br/>
If all else fails, ask the owner of the website or the person who made<br/>
the virtual box what's going on--whichever is most appropriate.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
