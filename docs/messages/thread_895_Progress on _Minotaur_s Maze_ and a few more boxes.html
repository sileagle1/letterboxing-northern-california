One thing I've been thinking about since I moved out here, is how I <br>
don't know the names of any of the trees.  I'll be "itchin' like a <br>
man on a fuzzy tree" when Paul plants his new box.<br>
<br>
And, no, I have no idea what Elvis had in mind when he sang that.  <br>
When I lived in Alabama, I was warned off the Spanish Moss, because <br>
it was reputed to be full of chiggers.  For all I know, he meant <br>
those crazy red bottle-brush looking tees that grow all over <br>
Berkeley.  They sure are sticky!<br>

Robb and I finally scooped up Mimulus' Upsidaisium today on the way <br>
to work.  Really cute.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, Robb had me test drive the clues on his newest box, <br>
Canadian Bandstand.  Unfortunately, his Cormorant Mystery Box has <br>
gone missing.<br>

That's one of the many wonderful things about letterboxing -- you <br>
can draw people's attention to things that they hadn't really <br>
noticed before. In the web page of clues I'm preparing, there is a <br>
link to Friends of the Urban Forest, the volunteers who do many of <br>
the street tree plantings here. I'm making a web page 'cheat sheet' <br>
quick reference to the specific trees you'll need to identify, and <br>
also the basic characteristics of Stick and Queen Anne Victorian <br>
houses. This box is hopefully just a starting point for people to <br>
begin really looking at this great city. The Friends of the Urban <br>
Forest offer free (and intersting) tree walking tours in various <br>
neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
Last year, I bought Michael Sullivan's book on San Francisco trees, <br>
and it opened my eyes to how much urban tree plantings improve the <br>
city environment. When I starting really looking at trees, they <br>
intrigued me. The color of the red flowering gum tree blossoms can <br>
stop me dead in my tracks & dazzle me. They're really a soft orange. <br>
Orange isn't usually my favorite color, but this hue is gorgeous, <br>
especially against a blue sky. New Zealand Christmas trees are also <br>
beautiful, with red spiky blossoms and silverey green foliage. <br>
<br>
SF was originally sand dunes, and scrub brush vegetation. Even <br>
though the vast majority of SF trees are non-native, they soften the <br>
hard concrete and asphalt terrain. I don't know who said this, but a <br>
wonderful quote is:<br>
<br>
     "Trees are poems that the earth writes in the sky."<br>
<br>
Today, I arrived at 'Emblem of Eros' to check on it, just as someone <br>
from Brooklyn was stamping in. I introduced myself, and she knew of <br>
me because she's a member of LbNY (which I founded last year). She <br>
had just found 'Vertigo1' as well. Wow! She's been <br>
busy... 'Nepenthe' was next on her list.<br>
<br>
Paul, as always, in SF<br>
