We made chocolate mousse last night, and our part of Oakland<br/>
repeatedly lost power.  We figured that if we didn't get our power<br/>
back before we finished, we would just dunk everything in the kitchen<br/>
in the melted chocolate, and collapse in a chocolate coma.  <br/>
<br/>
mmmmmm.... chocolate, beer and letterboxing!  I understand that<br/>
whatever you do on New Year's Day sets the tone for the rest of the year.<br/>

What if I do the workshop twice, about 2 - 3 weeks apart? That way, <br/>
people should be able to make one or the other session. All I ask is <br/>
that I get a minimum of 5 people in each.<br/>

Let's set Saturday, Feb. 25 as the date for the 1st session. Then <br/>
let's poll on whether Saturday, March 11 or March 18 will work best <br/>

I'm available any Saturday, with the exceptions of Jan 15 (Phoenix), <br/>
March 25, and April 1 (New York City). We need to do Saturdays because <br/>
the White Star Cafe @ the Presidio is closed on Sundays. Thanks for <br/>
