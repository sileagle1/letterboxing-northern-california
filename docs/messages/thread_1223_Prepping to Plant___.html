<br>
I hadn't been to active in the group lately, as I'd been finishing my<br>
second Bachelor's, but now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'm<br>
prepping to plant my first box. Knowing that a whole mess of rather<br>
prolific planters (who've given rise to some rather long-lived boxes)<br>
hung out here, I thought I'd ask if y'all had any advice for a<br>
first-timer as I'm keen to avoid any mistakes. Since I've been putting<br>
a good deal of work into the thing, I'd like it to stick around as<br>
long as possible as well, so any tips would be appreciated!<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
- Jeff/"Jack"<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm by no means even an "intermediate" planter, but on<br>
my first plant I learned never to use a container that<br>
had been used for any sort of food product -even when<br>
washed with soap and bleach (it was a cocoa<br>
container).  <br>
<br>
I noticed that boxes that seem to stick with us tend<br>
to be in places that don't have heavy traffic, and are<br>
tucked away where innocent bystanders (think kids<br>
who'll be climbing through brush and picking up loose<br>
rocks)won't happen upon them.<br>
<br>
The lock n lock boxes or containers with a similar<br>
locking device really seem to hold up better in wet<br>
conditions, and there is less chance of journal and<br>
stamp deterioration from moisture.<br>
<br>
I think it was the Kool Kats who use(d) camoflauge<br>
duct tape on some of their boxes (someone correct me<br>
if I'm wrong and I'm sorry if it wasn't the kool<br>
kats).  That really helped conceal the box when placed<br>
in or near bushes or trees. <br>
<br>
A couple boxes I've found have been attached with wire<br>
to the inside of bushes, and I thought that was a<br>
pretty interesting tactic.<br>
<br>
I'm sure others will have a lot to add. Meanwhile,<br>
we're looking forward to your creation!<br>

p.s. congrats on your degree completion.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few other thoughts, in no particular order:<br>
<br>
Stay away from places where people sit for long periods of time.  I<br>
find that anywhere that people are fishing is a bad letterbox location.<br>
<br>
Likewise, as yourself the following question:  "Is it likely that a<br>
homeless person lives under this bush?"  If the answer is yes, find<br>
somewhere else to plant.<br>
<br>
Make your letterbox as small as you possibly can.  <br>
<br>
Camo is good.<br>
<br>
Magnets are wonderful.<br>
<br>
There is no rule that letterboxes *have* to be in a plastic box, right?<br>
<br>
And really, really, really be respectful of the "rule" about not<br>
planting in sensitive areas or places that have stated that they don't<br>
welcome letterboxes.  Why antagonize the already underfunded National<br>
Park Service when there are a zillion other possible locations on<br>
which to hide a letterbox?<br>
<br>
And finally, remember that letterboxes are by their nature ephemeral<br>
items.  Make your peace with the fact that some of your letterboxes<br>
are going to go missing.  <br>
