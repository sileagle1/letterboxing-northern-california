his hops etc.  Sleepy Cat was pressed into service at a young age on <br/>
capper duty (by the way, if you need to borrow any equipment, we are a <br/>
little closer than the Cavalier).  The Best Man in our wedding even has <br/>
a Master's Degree in fermentation science!  Unfortunately he has gone <br/>
over to the dark side and now works for Anheuser Busch in St. Louis.<br/>
<br/>
And what to do on wet muddy days?  Well I did some boxing last year in <br/>
the rain (take an umbrella or clear plastic something to cover your <br/>
logbook) but this year I plan on staying in and carving new boxes!  Or <br/>
replacement boxes.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Well, Christmas has passed, and Robb and I are playing with his new<br/>
&gt;  toys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Which means that we're brewing beer.  And, my-oh-my, does our kitchen<br/>
&gt;  stink.  I never particularly liked the smell of breweries -- that<br/>
&gt;  damp, earthy, broccoli smell.  But this smell shall soon pass, and in<br/>
&gt;  about a month we'll have five gallons of wheat beer.  Eesh!  I can't<br/>
&gt;  quite wrap my brain around that fact. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Perhaps I'll invite the Bay Area Boxers over for a brew!  What do you<br/>
&gt;  think?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Earlier today, Robb and I went out to the site of FilmFamTam's boxes,<br/>
&gt;  but we couldn't bring ourselves to slog down the hill to where we<br/>
&gt;  thought the box was, or even open anyone's letterbox in such a<br/>
&gt;  downpour.  We stayed inside the Lindsay Wildlife Museum, and had a<br/>
&gt;  great time with the staff, who spent a lot of time discussing the<br/>
&gt;  various birds of prey that live at the museum.  It was a real treat to<br/>
&gt;  get so close to the birds, and see their beautiful markings.  The<br/>
&gt;  American Kestrels were lovely, as were the owls. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  What *do* you Bay Area letterboxers do in the wet months?<br/>
