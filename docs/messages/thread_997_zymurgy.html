                    <div class="plaintext-content">My husband Just John has also stunk up my kitchen on many occasion with <br>
his hops etc.  Sleepy Cat was pressed into service at a young age on <br>
capper duty (by the way, if you need to borrow any equipment, we are a <br>
little closer than the Cavalier).  The Best Man in our wedding even has <br>
a Master's Degree in fermentation science!  Unfortunately he has gone <br>
over to the dark side and now works for Anheuser Busch in St. Louis.<br>
<br>
And what to do on wet muddy days?  Well I did some boxing last year in <br>
the rain (take an umbrella or clear plastic something to cover your <br>
logbook) but this year I plan on staying in and carving new boxes!  Or <br>
replacement boxes.<br>
