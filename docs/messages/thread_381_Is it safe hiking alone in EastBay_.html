Here is a question for those of you who hike/letterbox in the East <br/>
Bay parks, especially women.  Do you consider it safe to hike alone?<br/>
Any problems with people being accosted?  By humans that is. I would <br/>
appreciate feedback as I am considering doing some solo letterboxing <br/>
in those areas.  I would never think twice about it here but since <br/>
the two kids were found murdered at the beach in Jenner I have been a <br/>
little more leery. Am I being paranoid?<br/>

Most of our hikes have been during the week, not on weekends.  We <br/>
have encountered very few other hikers and those that we have met <br/>
have seemed friendly.  We are a husband and wife, so cannot speak <br/>
about single hikes.  The most imposing creatures we have met so far <br/>
are very large bovines.  <br/>

I am a fairly cautious person and wouldn't recommend it, not just because of who else <br/>
might be on the trail, but because of environmental factors as well (falling, getting hurt <br/>
etc.)...If you do decide to go hiking on your own though, tell a friend or two exactly where <br/>
and when you plan to hike. If you have a cell phone, and it will have service, that would be <br/>
a good thing to have. <br/>
<br/>
The chances that something might happen to you are very low...but if you don't have to <br/>
take the chance, I wouldn't.<br/>

I am a woman and I hike alone quite a bit on my layovers all over the <br/>
United States. I always tell my crew where I am going and I leave a <br/>
note in my hotel room with my destination and when I plan to return. <br/>
<br/>
I have never had a problem in the San Francisco area. I am usually <br/>
doing my hiking in the middle of the day and during the week not <br/>
weekends.  (an added plus, the trails are less crowded and you can be <br/>
discreet!)<br/>
<br/>
When I planted the Nancy Drew series in Antioch, I was alone. On that <br/>
day I also did Contra Costa #4 and Castle Rock by myself. What I am <br/>
most worried about is hurting myself when I am alone on the trail. I <br/>
am quite the clutz and it would be just like me to be a mile out on <br/>
the trail and sprain my ankle or break something!! I always have my <br/>
cell phone with me, but sometimes I am in areas where it doesn't <br/>
work. <br/>
<br/>
You just should be aware of your abilities and your surroundings at <br/>
all times. If you feel uncomfortable at the trailhead...don't do the <br/>
hike, come back on another day or with a friend. And don't stay out <br/>
after dark when you are alone. I am much more cautious when I am by <br/>
myself. <br/>

I hike with my two kids (1 &amp; 4) from time to time and have never <br/>
encountered a sketchy person ar situation yet, but I always make <br/>
sure to leave contact information etc.  I have only done trails here <br/>
in the east bay w/o my husband along as I grew up here and feel very <br/>
familiar with the areas.  I don't think you are being to paranoid, <br/>
just be careful and aware...  Cathi<br/>
