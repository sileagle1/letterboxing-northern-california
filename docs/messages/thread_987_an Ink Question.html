Now as far as ink goes.  One of the logbooks of Planet Walk was<br/>
soaking wet, some of the pages had been totally effaced, and some were<br/>
fine.  This made us wonder what types of inks everyone is using.  So,<br/>
here are the images that remained perfect:<br/>
<br/>
We stamped into all those boxes and use LePlume markers to ink our stamps. <br/>
So, they run in the wet. Will have to change. However, we always write our <br/>
messages in ball point pen so our visit will never bleed away completely.<br/>
