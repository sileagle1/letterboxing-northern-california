So I am putting a request out to anyone who planted a box and left it <br>
planted to please contact me with the clues or name of the box( Is it <br>
posted to Letterboxing.org or AQ?) We thought possibly we could take a <br>
drive to Sacramento to find some maybe this Sunday. (hopin for that <br>
Lemony Snicket one too.  It has been almost 3 months since we have LB <br>
and I am getting withdrawls.  In the meantime I will try searching for <br>
some on my own. Mail me at Xs3mom@aol.com   Also a special TY for the <br>
Pics of the event.  It was nice to see some faces I reconized and some <br>
I didn't but hope to meet this summer.  Thanks so much.  <br>
