not following your link, which didn't work for me for some reason.<br/>

I think one thing that we really need to keep in mind is that many<br/>
animals become endangered species due to habitat degeneration.  So,<br/>
planting a letterbox in an animal's home might be a poor choice.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we could all plant letterboxes which celebrates the<br/>
biodiversity of the bay area, and educates people about helping these<br/>
threatened creatures.<br/>
<br/>
I've planted a few letterboxes about endangered species, but I think<br/>
they're all in Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to carve an image of an obscure endangered critter.<br/>

ps -- has anyone read the book "The Big Year?"  Those people were<br/>
INSANE.  <br/>
