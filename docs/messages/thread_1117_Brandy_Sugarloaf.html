&gt; something...?  I was looking at it last night.   Anyone done that one?<br/>
&gt; Jay's stamps out here in CT are fantastic.   :)<br/>

It didn't look like anyone mentioned that the series by Jay Drew is not <br/>
exactly up to Jay's normal standards.  I think I've only seen the first <br/>
one, and it is just some quickly carved words.  I believe several of <br/>
them are also missing, and the hike is a fairly long one (4+ miles?)  <br/>
As DoubleSaj points out, you would be better off doing the 2 Mimulus <br/>
loops at Sugarloaf, but you will need most of a day to accomplish <br/>
those.<br/>
