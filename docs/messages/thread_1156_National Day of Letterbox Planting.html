                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over at Atlas Quest, a suggestion has been made to designate May 24th <br>
as National Day of Letetrbox Planting (the specific day was chosen <br>
because it is also National Scavenger Hunt Day).  The challenge being <br>
put forward if for everyone around the country to plant a letterbox <br>
that day.  However, since it lands on a Wednesday, it will be to post <br>
your clues on the 24th, regardless if you plant the box(es) the weekend <br>
before or whenever.<br>
<br>
Okay, since I started writing this letter Aahz has already launched a <br>
"Santa Clara"-centric version of the day, which would be great to <br>
support.  However, if you can't get to Santa Clara County between then <br>
and now, please consider planting something nearer to home.<br>
