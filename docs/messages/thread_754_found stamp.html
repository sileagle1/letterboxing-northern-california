I knew she couldn't have gotten far. And I was dragging my feet on recarving. Just didn't want to!<br/>

We had snow yesterday. Will it be summer soon? Did a late evening drive on Sunday up to Ebbett's Pass for the new box up there. Way cold, but sooo beautiful! Up on top of the world in the granite Sierra.<br/>

Mim, you're a planting fool. You're the best!<br/>
