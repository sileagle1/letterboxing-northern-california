this box yet and I could not find it. This is box #2 of the Hwy 101 <br/>
Necklace series.  That makes two of the 8 boxes I have planted gone <br/>
missing or 25%.  SInce these are urban/suburban boxes in more <br/>
trafficked areas I suppose that is par for the course.  <br/>
<br/>
I will carve another stamp and rehide in a less maintained area, as I <br/>
suspect an overzealous gardener found it and removed.  <br/>
<br/>
On another note , my family and I watched Vetigo this weekend in <br/>
advance preparation for a trip next weekend to get that lettebox.  <br/>
What a great movie!  If it had not been for letterboxing and PAul in <br/>
SF I probably would have never seen the movie.  Or visited the mystery <br/>
location.  <br/>
