Hi Antigone<br/>
<br/>
I'm pleased that you have discovered letterboxing, and that you are<br/>
enjoying yourself. You may not be aware that publishing another<br/>
person's clues, box locations and stamp images (especially on a widely<br/>
read forum like Flickr) is considered a real breach of etiquette.<br/>
<br/>
For more information, here's a link to the Letterboxers' Code of Conduct:<br/>
<br/>
www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/rules/respect.html<br/>
<br/>
If everyone who uses Flickr in San Jose were to go solve these clues<br/>
without knowing anything else about letterboxing, this excellent box<br/>
would surely disappear, and then no other letterbox seekers would be<br/>
able to enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of everyone's enjoyment, it may be a good idea to remove<br/>
the "revealing" information from your photo's comment.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to ruin your fun.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
<br/>
Lisa<br/>
