I just set up a poll on the Yahoo groups site (access it online via groups.yahoo.com/<br>
group/LbNCA, using your Yahoo ID) to determine when we should have this get-together.  <br>
The choices are:<br>
<br>
Sunday December 19th in Oakland at Blackbird's school with Princess Lea leading the <br>
demo<br>
Monday December 27th at Mimulus's place in Sonoma County with Princess Lea leading <br>
the demo<br>
Saturday January 8th in Oakland (as above) with someone else leading the demo<br>
<br>
Let's please try to get a consensus on this!  I artitrarily pick next Friday the 19th as the <br>
deadline for the poll.  Sool with everyone?<br>
