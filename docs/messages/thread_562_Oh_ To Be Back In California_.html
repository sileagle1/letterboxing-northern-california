We have a few more days in New Hampshire, then will start our trek <br>
back to God's country, boxing as we go.<br>
<br>
New England is still very beautiful, in a white, cold manner, but it <br>
is not very conducive to letterboxing in winter.  Well, we did <br>
manage to find 24 boxes one Saturday recently in Connecticut, but <br>
then more snow arrived to freeze and hide everything around again!<br>
<br>
We've noted all the new letterboxes placed recently in Northern <br>
California.  Way to go!  We can hardly wait to get out there search <br>
for your handiwork.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.<br>
<br>
We've been carving while staying out of the frozen elements, so <br>
perhaps we can increase the total number of boxes there once we <br>
return.  Hoping we'll be able to get to the Old Sac gathering April <br>
30th and meet some of you.  We want to put faces to the trail names!<br>
