<br/>
A postal letterbox is a letterbox that is Mailed (via snail mail) <br/>
from person to person. Usually the person who creates the Postal <br/>
Letterbox compiles a list of people who would like the box. Then the <br/>
box is mailed from one person to the next on the list. <br/>
<br/>
Some boxes have specific themes--A Postal Letterbox for Moms, A <br/>
Postal Letterbox trying to get to all 50 states, A Postal Letterbox <br/>
for everyone who has found 100 letterboxes etc. <br/>
<br/>
Usually the person who creates the box will annouce on one of the <br/>
Yahoo Groups Boards information about the letterbox and ask if <br/>
anybody would like to be included in the mailing list. Once you are <br/>
part of the list, it is your responsibility to keep the Postal <br/>
Letterbox moving by stamping it and sending it on to the next person <br/>
as soon as possible.<br/>

&amp; also Lea! Does the box ever make its way back to the<br/>
launcher? Probably just like any other box...when the<br/>
log is full.<br/>
<br/>
Note to Old Blue: yesterday I ran into the woman who<br/>
introduced me to letterboxing (little did she know<br/>
what a gift/Pandora's box she gave me!) &amp; it turns out<br/>
she's your cousin! She was amused by how seriously<br/>
I've been bitten by the bug...we were in our shop &amp;<br/>
some people overheard us &amp; asked, "people don't travel<br/>
specificly to letterbox, do they?". I just had to<br/>
laugh. :-) I remember reading the article in<br/>
Smithsonian, but it must have been a timing thing,<br/>
because I thought it was cool, but didn't relate it to<br/>
me. I don't remember if I even had a computer then.<br/>
<br/>
Love the fishing vest idea...<br/>

<br/>
Be forewarned though that many of these boxes are exclusive to certain <br/>
people. There's a box for people who were born in October (the Libra Box) another <br/>
which insists you try  a recipe inside the box before you send it back out, and <br/>
still another that made you write a story about a summer vacation you remember <br/>
as a child before they'd add you to the list. Also, each box is usually <br/>
restricted to the first 25 or 35 or 50 respondents. It's not always easy to get <br/>
into each box unless you read the email every day.<br/>
<br/>
 Each and every box is NOT for every letterboxer.<br/>

It just depends on the postal box in question.  There's a type of box<br/>
for EVERYONE--you just need to find the ones you qualify for.  ;o)<br/>

The postal letterboxing board is at<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/postal_letterboxing/<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is only for the Seasonned letterboxers who have placed and been<br/>

<br/>
No, unseasonaed letterboxers who have planted boxes which have been<br/>
vandalized are eligble too.  =)  You have to read the fine print.  I<br/>
don't remember seeing a disclaimer saying you can't plant a box and<br/>
vandalize it yourself in order to be elgible.  ;o)<br/>
