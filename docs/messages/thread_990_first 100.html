<br/>
    You still haven't been to Tahoe! And could probably hit your 100 just  in a day. You haven't gotten Night Thieves or Placerville Pony Express,  which are on the way in Placerville. Bridal Veil Falls and Totem are  also on the way &amp; very short walks. Happy Holidays is a drive-by. A  Day at Valhalla is a nice little walk and the little one would be fine  in a stroller.<br/>
<br/>
    Or you could just go to the Markleeville area and get a bunch. Snowshoe  Thompson (almost a drive-by), Fishing the West Fork and Woodfords Pony  Express (a definite drive-by) are on the way, then there are a bunch  accessible from Grover Hot Springs. (If you were brave in cold weather,  you could camp there, give yourself a little more time, and take  advantage of the soothing waters at the hot springs!) Mim's Before and  After (4) and my Fishing the West Fork (3) could probably be done with  a sport stroller, definitely with a baby pack.<br/>
<br/>
    Another fun possiblity is the Auburn/Grass Valley/Nevada City area. If  you're taking the long drive, be sure to get Ruff and Reddy and  Bridgeport.<br/>
<br/>
    So many great choices!! If you do come up to the mountains, know that  the roads are mostly clear, we're not expecting any precipitation  anytime soon (Sunday? one can only hope) &amp; it's pretty cold, so  wear those layers.<br/>
<br/>
    Have fun!<br/>
