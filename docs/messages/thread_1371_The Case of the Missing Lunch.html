<br/>
Da Kool Kats were really having an "off day", today.  We hurried to<br/>
get the box of dem xx men before they pulled it and ended up leaving<br/>
our wheeled blue ice chest behind.  When we got to the bright lights<br/>
of Vacaville I had Gary pull over so I could make a sandwich and<br/>
discovered the missing ice chest and lunch.  We drove back to the park<br/>
but it was gone.  I hope it is in the care of one of our letterboxing<br/>
friends.  Let us know if you have it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for the wonderful stamps we managed to get.  We have got<br/>
to go back another day for quite a few others that we missed.  <br/>
<br/>
