 <br>
Hi all!<br>
<br>
We are new to letterboxing (six months) and we will be placing our<br>
first box soon. I would like to carve the stamp, but dont know where<br>
to get the stuff. Can it be as simple as cutting up a pink pearl<br>
eraser? If someone knows where to get the stuff please let me know. I<br>
dont like to shop on line much... I need the personal interaction. For<br>
my first box I would like everything just so. Not that I'm anal or<br>
anything.<br>

Letterboxing is very different from geocaching. There are no trade <br>

the letterbox stamp (letterbox has stamp and book, and finder has <br>
their own stamp and book).  The finder then re-hides the letterbox <br>
in the spot they found it for the next hunter to find.  Also, <br>
letterboxes are not normally buried in the ground, but hidden in <br>

Exactly!  So I have a stampbook filled with colorful stamp images <br>
from all the letterboxes I've found.  Letterboxes are usually hidden <br>
in interesting or unusual places that letterboxers have discovered; <br>
often secret little places that the average person wouldn't have <br>
normally known about, so travelling to the location to look for the <br>
boxes is an adventure in itself, and having the beautiful stamped <br>
image in your stampbook is like a holiday photo--it recalls in your <br>
mind the adventure you had in finding the box.<br>
