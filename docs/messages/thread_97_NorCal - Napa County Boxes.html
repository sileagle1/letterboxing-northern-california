<br>
Clan Jiggs took advantage of the "lovely" Ontario-like spring wet <br>
weather here in CA to add to out find total, by taking a little road <br>
trip into the heart of the Napa valley!<br>
<br>
We were fortunate enough to find the following boxes in almost-<br>
perfect condition...<br>
<br>
Napa...Not Wine - a great box in a stunning setting located <br>
in...well' you'll just have to figure that out! Log book was about <br>
half-full, but soggy, even inside 2 ziplocks.<br>
<br>
Westwood Hills Regional Park series #1 and 2 - both boxes found <br>
after another leisurely, uphill stroll. #1 has seen about twice the <br>
traffic as #2. Interesting to note that DoublesAJ and Old Blue <br>
haven't hit these ones yet!!!<br>
<br>
By the way, we had lunch in a super brewpub in Napa called the <br>
Silverad Brewing Company...where we took a beer(!) tour of the Napa <br>
Valley for a very reasonable $3.50!!!  Food was great, too!<br>
<br>
See you in Kernville...<br>
