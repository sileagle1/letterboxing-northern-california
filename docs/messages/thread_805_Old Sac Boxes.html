Carole,<br>
Thank you for the update.  I was reluctant to list it as missing when <br>
it was first reported to me, but when the last three to respond - said <br>
it was missing, what can you do.  I was already making plans for <br>
another trip up north, possibly in September, to replace it.  I will <br>
change the clues back.  Thank you so much for checking on it.<br>

I  have been checking your boxes regularly and I will almost bet the<br>
Theater box and Pony Express boxes are still there.  If any are<br>
missing, it would be the RR Museum box.  I'm surprised that it has<br>
lasted as long as it has. Almost every week-end the caboose is rented<br>
out for birthday parties and they (the children) leave very little<br>
untouched.  Also, during the week schools send children to Old Sac on<br>
field trips and the caboose and theater are always bombarded with<br>
busy, inquisitive children. <br>
<br>
I will also check on your boxes, possibly this week, because I know<br>
exactly where they are.  <br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing you.<br>

months is about all I should expect from an urban box.  I just hate <br>
to lose all 3 logbooks with so many stamps in them.  I would re-carve <br>
any one stamp, but will retire the series if all 3 are gone.<br>
<br>
Thank you one again, looking forward to your update.<br>

Obviously I didn't.  Most have sent it to someone personally. <br>
Whomever received it, I'm sorry.  It was intended for the list.  If<br>
you will forward it to the list, I would greatly appreciate you doing so.<br>
<br>
Just a quick update:  There are still 9 boxes in Old Sac.<br>
Lee and Nancy's Pony Express and Eagle Theater<br>
Da Kool Kats Old Landmark, Up, Up & Away, U-Neak Pig & Bit-O-Heaven<br>
NancyAnne & Doug's Old Sac<br>
artTrekker's Prospector and Rattlesnake Dick<br>
<br>
Saddened to inform that the following are definitely missing:  <br>
