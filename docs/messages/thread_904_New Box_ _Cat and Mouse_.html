<br/>
Here's a box that's been in secret progress for a while. It's <br/>
called 'Cat &amp; Mouse', and features a cat named (of all things), Ortus. <br/>
There's some sort of pet/owner relationship between Ortus, and The <br/>
Therapeutist... but who the heck can figure it out. The 2 boxes are in <br/>
the same general area, but NOT down in the depths.<br/>

And now, here starts the race -- Anna &amp; the Kids versus Princess Lea! <br/>
Who will be the first finder? Place your bets now... (actually, I'm <br/>
betting on Ortus)...<br/>

Anna and the Kids! <br/>
<br/>
I cannot beat them to these boxes! <br/>
<br/>
The area is really nice.  For those who want to take a<br/>
little extended hike, there is a path that goes<br/>
throught the eucalyptus forest. You'll have to back<br/>
track out of there, but it is neat because you forget<br/>
that you are in a densely populated city when you are<br/>
up there! Oh, and wear mosquito repellant!<br/>

<br/>
In case everyone thinks I don't have a life-- I lucked<br/>
out on this one---I was going into the city anyway for<br/>
free Tuesdays at the Museum of the Legion of Honor and<br/>
happened to see the box come up...  How could I<br/>
resist????  Me-ow!<br/>
<br/>
I agree, it is a pretty, pretty place...  I went in<br/>
the AM and no skeeter issues for me-- though late<br/>
afternoon may be different.<br/>
<br/>
I say thanks to you too, Paul-- Maybe I'll bump into<br/>
you, Red, on the next one!!!!!!<br/>
