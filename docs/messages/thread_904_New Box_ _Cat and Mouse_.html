you're waiting patiently for 'The Minotaur's Maze' (you can hear the <br>
minotaur snorting and stomping his hooves in the background). <br>
<br>
Here's a box that's been in secret progress for a while. It's <br>
called 'Cat & Mouse', and features a cat named (of all things), Ortus. <br>
There's some sort of pet/owner relationship between Ortus, and The <br>
Therapeutist... but who the heck can figure it out. The 2 boxes are in <br>
the same general area, but NOT down in the depths.<br>
<br>
Here's the link: http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/cat%20and%<br>

<br>
And now, here starts the race -- Anna & the Kids versus Princess Lea! <br>
Who will be the first finder? Place your bets now... (actually, I'm <br>
betting on Ortus)...<br>

Anna and the Kids! <br>
<br>
I cannot beat them to these boxes! <br>
<br>
The area is really nice.  For those who want to take a<br>
little extended hike, there is a path that goes<br>
throught the eucalyptus forest. You'll have to back<br>
track out of there, but it is neat because you forget<br>
that you are in a densely populated city when you are<br>
up there! Oh, and wear mosquito repellant!<br>
<br>
thanks, Paul  =)<br>

<br>
In case everyone thinks I don't have a life-- I lucked<br>
out on this one---I was going into the city anyway for<br>
free Tuesdays at the Museum of the Legion of Honor and<br>
happened to see the box come up...  How could I<br>
resist????  Me-ow!<br>
<br>
I agree, it is a pretty, pretty place...  I went in<br>
the AM and no skeeter issues for me-- though late<br>
afternoon may be different.<br>
<br>
I say thanks to you too, Paul-- Maybe I'll bump into<br>
you, Red, on the next one!!!!!!<br>
<br>
