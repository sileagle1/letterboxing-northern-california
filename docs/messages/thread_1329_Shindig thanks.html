YOu know, I do not even know some of your real names but I wouldn't<br/>
mind taking a long road trip with any of you in a small car with<br/>
animals and a touchy transmission..and that is saying a lot. (Of<br/>
course we would stop for a driveby boxes).   <br/>
<br/>
It is great to have a community close by, but the internet and<br/>
letterboxing helps us have community wherever we go.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone for sharing your creative genius and spark.  <br/>
<br/>
PS: I am making a few extra stamps for those who missed any of the<br/>
circus..so let me know if you are missing any and i can get them to<br/>
you. But pleases reply soon, I want to get the stamps back to<br/>
Ringmaster Boch.  <br/>
