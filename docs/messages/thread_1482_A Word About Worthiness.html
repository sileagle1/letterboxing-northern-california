                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Most of you don't know me, and the very few who do only through a few<br>
e-mails under my trail-name. I'm a very casual letter-boxer and<br>
somewhat shy in groups. This said, I feel I really need to speak up.<br>
I was very concerned to read the suggestion that letterbox clues<br>
should only go to the worthy. Who is worthy? I certainly would not be<br>
by most of your standards, I only grab letterboxes when I have time<br>
and energy and mostly I use them as a reward for taking a little time<br>
to get out somewhere new. I realize most of you are still upset about<br>
the ditz who messed with the Sharfenberger box. I was too,<br>
particularly since I was trying to find it at the same time and have a<br>
sneaking suspicion that she might have ruined my chance at it. But<br>
that's no reason to close off the hobby to everyone else. I prefer<br>
letter-boxing to geocaching because it is so much more accessible;<br>
anyone with a stamp, an ink pad and a little taste for mystery can do<br>
it. I love introducing children to letter-boxing as a way to get them<br>
excited about hiking and logical reasoning. I think that would be<br>
ruined by making the clues available to only a select few. Even if I<br>
somehow made the cut, it would put a bad taste in my mouth to know<br>
that someone was judging me like that.<br>
Anyway, that's my two cents and sorry if I offended anybody.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to agree with Stephanie. I can only imagine the frustration <br>
of having to plant and re-plant a box, but one does wonder fi you <br>
are constantly having to plant and replant if that is really a good <br>
spot to be planting? Any boxes planted in urban areas run the risk <br>
of being discovered by the wrong people and then go missing. There <br>
are many boxes who have survived in the wild for years because of <br>
their ideal location, despite being found by multiple people. I <br>
agree that it only takes one person to re-hide poorly to ruin the <br>
fun for everyone else, but why make it worse for so many more people <br>
by being elitist with the clues? <br>
<br>
I am sure that I would be qualified enough to receive WOM clues, but <br>
as I really do not know any other boxers personally (except for just <br>
a few I have met only once), I would never be the recipiant of the <br>
WOM clues. <br>
<br>
If you have a stamp with a questionable image, or one you hold very <br>
dear and you want to make it a WOM box, then great, it is your <br>
stamp, your work of art, anything you like would go and I do not <br>
have a problem with that... but isn't the point of letterboxing <br>
sharing your art and particular locations with others? Art is meant <br>
to be shared not with a limited few but with everyone. =o) (Ok, you <br>
could argue that we are still limiting to just letterboxers, but you <br>
see my point).  <br>
<br>
I am a very conscientious boxer, so I know that nothing bad being <br>
said here about boxers applies to me, but if people started pulling <br>
boxes and making them WOM I would be one of the people excluded from <br>
the hunt. <br>
<br>
Ok, stepping off my box now. Sorry to rant but all too frequently I <br>
have seen this topic and it makes me sad to feel that I may be <br>
slowly excluded from a hobby I have grown to love. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, since I am the one who used the word worthy, and I'm really<br>
sorry to have offended anyone, I didn't mean to (I always forget that<br>
it's easy to take a mis-step on the list), I'll have to say a little<br>
more about it. By worthy, I only meant folks that could be counted on<br>
to take care of the boxes they find. I would have to assume that means<br>
at least all the people who belong to this list, since they have seen<br>
the posts from everyone advocating secrecy and good custodianship.<br>
<br>
I don't know how much planting Stephanie or Rhea have done, so I don't<br>
know if they know how much energy, time and creativity it takes to<br>
plant a good box. We do our best to choose appropriate hiding places,<br>
and I agree that if a box has to be replanted numerous times, perhaps<br>
that's a good clue that it's not a good hiding spot. That's why the<br>
Healdsburg Quartet no longer exists. But it's also interesting to see<br>
which ones do last a long time, and you can only know by trying. I<br>
just really dislike the idea that my boxes can go missing because<br>
someone on the inside was irresponsible. As a finder, I find plenty of<br>
boxes that were not carefully rehidden, and that has nothing to do<br>
with the appropriateness of the hiding place. Please don't be glib<br>
about what planters should or shouldn't do until you are intimate<br>
yourself with all that is involved. We WANT people to find our boxes;<br>
but we also want our boxes to be there for people to find.<br>
<br>
By worthy, I meant that harder clues might be a good system for boxers<br>
to earn certain boxes. I like the idea of flagging boxes that are more<br>
appropriate for beginners, and making clues progressively harder for <br>
boxes for more advanced boxers. It shouldn't feel like being judged,<br>
it should feel like something more challenging to aspire to.  There<br>
are so many boxes out there, I really don't see anyone running short<br>
of options. Think of other activities that have different levels to<br>
achieve: beginning skiers do not get out on the toughest slopes,<br>
beginning or even intermediate piano students wouldn't dream of taking<br>
on a concerto for their recital, skydivers do not get to free fall<br>
solo until they've met the criteria required of them to do so, golfers<br>
of most amateur levels hesitate to take on the most difficult courses.<br>
I could go on and on (chess! cooking! knitting! spelling! languages!<br>
ice skating! rock climbing! bridge!), and I don't see why letterboxing<br>
should be any different. I will defend the right of other planters to<br>
put a store-bought stamp in a box and write simple clues, as long as<br>
they defend my right to carve an intricate stamp and provide very<br>
cryptic clues. Kind of like free speech. Something for everyone.<br>
<br>
Whew, I guess that qualifies as at least five cents.<br>
<br>
Just keep boxing!  aT<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a note, I also agree with Arttrekker... I love the idea of <br>
progressively more difficult clues! I think that is a fantastic way <br>
of protecting boxes that are more dear and rewarding boxers who have <br>
been at this a long time... and yet that does not necessarily <br>
exclude the extremely clever noobie... <br>
<br>
I admit to not having planted many boxes yet, so I of course do not <br>
lay all the blame on the planters, please do not misunderstand. But <br>
at the same time, how many times have you seen large rocks stuck up <br>
in the Y of a tree... not exactly blending in with the environment! <br>
(I have found a few boxes this way and wonder how long they will <br>
last there) And yes, as a finder I have definitely found my share of <br>
poorly rehidden boxes in places that otherwise would have been <br>
fabulous. Yes, part of the risk of planting is that it may go <br>
missing. Not that long ago on AQ there was the "Challenge of the <br>
Sprite" where that was exactly the point... whose box would last the <br>
longest before it went missing! That too can be part of the fun of <br>
this game we call letterboxing =o) Some of the fun of planting is <br>
knowing that you are putting something out there that millions <br>
(potentially) of people will pass by without even knowing there is <br>
something there to find! I personally love that part!<br>
<br>
I was only speaking up against the thought that more clues should be <br>
WOM in order to hide them from noobies and keeping them safe that <br>
way. <br>
<br>
Cheers to all!<br>
