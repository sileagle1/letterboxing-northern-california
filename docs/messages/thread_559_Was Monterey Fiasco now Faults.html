Yes, you are not supposed to climb down in the fault, but we couldn't resist going down a little ways. The crevice was fairly narrow, but wide enough you couldn't jump across. If you are in the Mammoth Lakes area you can find it in our Enigmas, Illusions, Opposites, and Oddities near Hwy 395 letterbox. The Pink Elephant is at Fault is the start of the series.<br>

  Places where I've stood on a<br>
  fault line, the best I could do is say, "This side is the ABC plate,<br>
  that side is the XYZ plate, and the fault line is the 20 feet between<br>
  the two."<br>
