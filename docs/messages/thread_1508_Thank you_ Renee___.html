No Foolin!  All the flourishes and thoughtful details just boggled the<br>
mind.  The table runners!  The excellent name tags!  The beautifully<br>
run raffle!  The mother-lode of stamping supplies!  The fantastic<br>
location!  The general feeling of security, with the increased police<br>
presence!  THE FOOD!!!!! <br>

I just hope that Renee didn't lose a year off her life with the scare<br>
she got, thanks to the San Jose Merry Pranksters.<br>

Both Robb and I hope to get back to Alum Rock Park, to scoop up the<br>
letterboxes that we missed.<br>
<br>
Our only regret is that we didn't find enough time to fully enjoy all<br>
the people and event stamps.  There were just too many fun things to<br>
do, and we tend to move a bit slowly.  (Please tell Outdoor Ed Mel<br>
that we left her orienteering workshop because Robb needed to lay<br>
down, not because of any other reason.)<br>
<br>
Thanks for everyone who made this day so incredible!<br>

See you all at the Egg-Stravaganza this Saturday?<br>

extend a hearty thank-you to the organizer of the event.  No one <br>
tramped through our vegetable gardens.  No one velcroed or otherwise <br>
attached small boxes to our houses.  <br>
<br>
We observed your festivities from afar, but were reluctant to come <br>
down and join in.  It is probably better that way.  <br>
<br>
However, a word of warning to a Ms. Lisascenic.  We saw your boxes.  <br>
We can run faster than you.  We can drag you and your cats (we do not <br>
subsist on a diet solely consisting of poodles, of course) off into <br>
the bowels of this park, and no one will be able to find you in time.  <br>

This was our first gathering and we had a blast meeting our fellow letterboxers, searching for boxes, and chowing down on some great food.  We hope to see everyone again soon.  Maybe in Sacramento in September!<br>
