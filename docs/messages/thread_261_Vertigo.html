Well, don't rush on our account! A good letterbox is much more <br>
important than making sure it gets up sometime this millenium.  ;o)<br>

Dear Princess, bear with me as I'm leaving for a week's vacation on a cruise ship in the hurricane-blown Caribbean. I do have comments for Vertigo 2 clues, but need to look at them some more. Will tackle that project when I get back -- IF I return, that is...<br>
