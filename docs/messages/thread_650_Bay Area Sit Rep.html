Got 5 boxes today and one HH, thought we'd let you all know.<br>
<br>
Sobrante Ridge by pawca in El Sobrante, a beautiful, easy shady, <br>
hike. We were first finders!<br>
Yo, Ho, Yo HO and A Pirate's Life for Me by Tara She's a great carver <br>
and these stamps can be found very close to the aforementioned <br>
Sobrante box. Also in this wonderful gem of a regional park (Kennedy <br>
Grove, off San Pablo Dam Road) are at least 8 other boxes. This place <br>
is a real treat for all ages.<br>
At Point Pinole Letterboxes in Richmond we got #1 but had to be <br>
at "the in-laws" by a certain time and regretfully had to postpone <br>
the other 2 boxes here until another day. <br>
Sandlot in Benicia was our 3rd try. First time it was too dark, <br>
second time we didn't have our book with us but this time we got it. <br>
Not that it's difficult to find. the tough part is waiting for a time <br>
when no one's looking!<br>
<br>
Placed the Cupid Stamp HH in one of these boxes. This HH is from <br>
Connecticut and we've had it quite a while because there's not been a <br>
box large enough to fit it in. So, go out and get it!<br>
