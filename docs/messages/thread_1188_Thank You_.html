                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to thank Blackbird, OB Juan, and Princess Lea for such a great day of <br/>
letterboxing!  I picked up the first in Blackbird's series at Huckleberry that I <br/>
missed when I was just starting out with letterboxing (I still haven't found <br/>
#2), and got the Whaling series and Lea's companion box.  <br/>
<br/>
I wasn't tuned in enough to the poetry of I'm Ya Huckleberry to orient myself <br/>
on that letterbox.  I need to give it a bit more thought, and try again.<br/>
<br/>
Lovely day.  Loads of wildflowers and creatures.  I came home with nature in <br/>
my hair, from laying in the forest floor while photographing columbine.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, everyone!  Hope to see some of you tomorrow!<br/>
