Thanks! Yoder is a common Amish name. Now all I need to do is finish <br>

I was sort of kidding, because every Amish woman I know is named Mrs.<br>

Getting back on topic, I do have a letterbox in NY about all the Amish<br>
families who are moving to Otsego County, because they can still<br>
afford to be farmers, there.  I would send the link to the box "Our<br>
Friends, the Amish," but I can't seem to log onto Atlas Quest.<br>

Thanks, Lisa! I'll look for it on Atlasquest.<br>
