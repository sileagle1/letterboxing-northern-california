I would love to improve my carving skills and think a winter demo is a <br/>
grand idea!  I am going to go out on a limb and offer my house...I <br/>
think it may be big enough to accomodate such an event.  (What do you <br/>
think Princes Lea..you have been here?) We had 26 for a sit down <br/>
Thanksgiving last year....but it was tight.  And if the weather is <br/>
clement we can expand out to the patio.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not know if people want to drive to Sonoma County, but it sounds <br/>
like there could be enough to justify a mini-gathering.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of a mall could work too....although it would not be my first <br/>
choice...the food court at our mall here is usually a zoo....but <br/>
perhaps a coffeehouse, scads of those around here.  <br/>

I don't know...) but would love to meet some of you guys that I didn't get to meet at the last gathering if I have the chance.  It could be just like a gathering with group carving, without the tough planning issues (box planting, food, etc.).  The mall by my house is a ZOO too, but that was a good thought!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, here's what I'm thinking for the "winter activity/carving demo" - <br/>
it seems like it would be best to have it at a place with lots of <br/>
tables and parking, which is why I am leaning towards a mall.  However, <br/>
someone's house would be cozier, so I guess there are advantages to <br/>
both.  I really have no idea how many would be in attendance, but it's <br/>
sounding like maybe a lot since there are lots of excited newcomers.  I <br/>
count 33 people in the photo from the 7/31 event and I can wisely say <br/>
that the turnout will be more, less or about the same as that.<br/>
<br/>
I can only do it the couple of days after Thanksgiving (not such a good <br/>
time to be at a mall though), or the week between Christmas and New <br/>
Years.  However, I'm sure there are lots of you out there that could <br/>
conduct a carving lesson without me, so it's not that crucial that I be <br/>
there.  If you ask Ryan or Amanda really nicely, maybe they could <br/>
arrange to come down from Seattle and teach us a thing or two, not just <br/>
about carving, but also how to write devious clues.<br/>

If Tortuga Verde and GF come, you'll need more than the food court at the <br/>
Mall for space! EVERYONE will want to come!<br/>
