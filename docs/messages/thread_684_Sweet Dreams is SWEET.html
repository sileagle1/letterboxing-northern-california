How wonderful...Tuesday morning is the day I allow myself a few hours <br>
hiking time and there is a new series in Petaluma.  I hightailed to <br>
Putnam Regional Park and got the set. Very nice!   And wonderful <br>
wildflowers this time of year.  Moon Rabbit did an excellent job. <br>
Allow extra time as this seems to be a very popular park with lots of <br>
traffic....bring binoculars or field guide books....I found making it <br>
look like I was "botanizing" a good cover.  I did key out a new <br>
wildflower for me (yello parentucellia) so not far from the truth.  <br>

doing this series and amazingly, the more stamps one<br>
