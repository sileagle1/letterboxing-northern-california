You will pick a card that has 2 questions on it. Luck of the draw. If you<br>
get the first one wrong, don't worry, you have one more chance. If you get<br>
them BOTH  wrong I get to place the stamp image on your forehead for<br>
everyone to see, instead of in your book...oh no....that's not it. We'll<br>
