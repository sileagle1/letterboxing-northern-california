Our letterboxing weekend extravaganza was cut short by a mean old <br/>
cold germ.  Grinch is fairly green about the gills - partly from the <br/>
cold and partly from envy of all of you who were well enough to <br/>
attend the carving demo in Oakland.  Will you share with all of us, <br/>
please?  Who was there?  What did you learn?  Inquiring green minds <br/>
want to know.<br/>

<br/>
Sorry you got green and missed the shindig. I'm happy to share with you (and<br/>
all others who missed it) our experience.<br/>
<br/>
My son and I went and enjoyed ourselves very much. There were about fifteen<br/>
people present with 12 stamps amongst us I believe, PLUS ArtTrekker got<br/>
recruited to create, on the spot, an event stamp! Princess Lea shared some<br/>
tips that were very helpful to us newbies. A real revolution was the idea of<br/>
drawing in pencil what we want to carve - on paper or tracing paper, NOT<br/>
directly on the stamp - then placing the paper face down on the stamping pad<br/>
and rolling a pencil over it to pass the image onto the stamp pad. Presto -<br/>
you get a mirror-image drawing to carve, making your stamp itself come out<br/>
the way you intend it! (I couldn't get the hang of drawing mirror-image<br/>
before, and keep forgetting that it will not stamp correctly if there are<br/>
any letters involved!) You may have known this already, but for us it was<br/>
truly revolutionary and a great relief from thinking we'll have to work with<br/>
a mirror to "get it right"!<br/>
<br/>
We watched BlackBird carve an intricate series of curvy shapes, and were<br/>
amazed to observe that she rotates the STAMP rather than the carving<br/>
instrument. This makes her lines much smoother than anything I've been able<br/>
to achieve before. (Okay, then I tried it, and my lines were still not as<br/>
smooth, but they were improved! She does have much more practice....)<br/>
<br/>
We also got much more clear in our minds the difference between carving out<br/>
the lines and carving everything BUT the lines. To celebrate this<br/>
understanding, my son and I carved an alien and its reverse/shadow :-).<br/>
<br/>
My son doesn't tend to want to spend any time in group gatherings of any<br/>
sort, but he enjoyed about 2.5 of the 3 hours or so that we spent at the<br/>
gathering - which is as high a compliment to everyone present as I can<br/>
share!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it was really the best to put faces to some of the names we've seen<br/>
while letterboxing! Thanks to all who came, shared, brought yummy stuff,<br/>
etc., and especially to BlackBird for chatting, hosting and supplying,<br/>
Princess Lea for officially teaching, ArtTrekker for the event stamp, and<br/>
Mimulus for she knows what.<br/>

I'm always surprised when people mention how surprised THEY are when<br/>
they learn we don't draw images directly onto the carving block.  I<br/>
sometimes forget that not everyone has had carving lessons!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I created a carving tutorial at<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/carving/ which mentions all of the<br/>
carving tips you mentioned in your post and possibily some others you<br/>
may not know about.  If you're really serious about wanting to carve<br/>
some really amazing carvings, it's definitely worth while to check out!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I wasn't able to make the shindig, but I won't be getting into<br/>
California until later this week.  =(<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
