                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a few moments to myself yesterday and decided to spend them <br/>
looking for some of the new boxes in the City.  It gives this SF <br/>
native no end of pleasure to think of the growth of the hobby in this <br/>
area.  I found Tara's 3 San Francisco Landmarks series and Ronald <br/>
Reagan boxes (also a hitchhiker in the last of the SF series).  <br/>
Darling hand carved stamps!  Glad to hear that you like carving <br/>
Tara!  The first box was completely exposed - I could see it from the <br/>
trail.  Looked like the work of critters, so I replaced it and put a <br/>
heavy branch on top to discourage future zoo-vandalism.  <br/>
<br/>
I also attempted The Moonbird but ran into some trouble.  Paul - I'll <br/>
write to you personally to see if I was in the right place, but I <br/>
couldn't figure out what "go to the bottom" meant in the clue.<br/>
<br/>
I also need to make a report about the Monterey peninsula trip I took <br/>
a couple weeks ago.  Life has intruded on my letterboxing and <br/>
prevented me from posting (and hunting!) a lot lately, but I'm glad <br/>
to have this hobby to keep my mind on positive and happy thoughts (as <br/>
long as I stay away from the LbNA board that is!).  So, more soon<br/>

Since I have a special box planned for visitors to the city, entitled, "I Left My Heart", why don't I open this theme up to anyone interested in building a series?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone coming to San Francisco is hereby invited to create a letterbox, and plant it where they think their heart remains in the City by the Bay. What spot makes your heart want to remain? Claim that spot with a letterbox, and you will have the chance to leave a bit of your heart behind.<br/>
<br/>
It'd be great if you'd start the series, and anyone that joins in will be the next in the series: "I Left My Heart #1", "I Left My Heart #2", and so on.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I'm going to post this idea on the LbNA board as well.<br/>
<br/>
Accept the invitation to do "I Left My Heart #1"?<br/>

critters got to the first box, thank you for finding a heavy branch <br/>

Because of my newbie-ness to planting, I made a couple of stupid <br/>
mistakes...first, I forgot to stamp my stams into MY logbook (d'oh!) <br/>
and I forgot to stamp my personal stamp into the letterboxes log <br/>
books.  I plan on having my husband find the SF landmarks one <br/>
weekend, since he didn't plant them with me...and I'll have to stamp <br/>
everything in then :P  Oops!<br/>
