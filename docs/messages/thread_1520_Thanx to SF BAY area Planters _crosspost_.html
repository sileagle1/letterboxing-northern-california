finds in my logbook WAHOO. i couldn't have done it without all your<br>
clues, all your stamps and all your love put into this hobby. Was i<br>
crazed? YES! Was i addicted? YES! Was i having fun? YES. Was i lost<br>
and confused sometimes? YES! LOL<br>
You took me to places i didn't know existed. i saw gorgeous views. i<br>
got ideas for logbooks, containers and clues, stamps and hidey holes.<br>
i met fellow boxers. What a great gift you have given me. i can't wait<br>
until my next visit when i can find the ones i missed.<br>
