weather. This 'loop' of boxes we made is a good one, taking us from Yuba City, <br/>
up to Grass Valley then over to Folsom. We highly recommend it!! Here's a <br/>
status report:<br/>
<br/>
Bok Kai--first finders<br/>
Ruff &amp; Ready--a wedding in progress culminating with the honking of horns<br/>
    as we got the second box was a real bonus to these cute stamps. For<br/>
    anyone who watched the Ruff &amp; Ready cartoons as a kid, you won't be <br/>
    able to get that darned theme song out of your head!!<br/>
Bridgeport-- what an interesting place and a great, big stamp! This is the <br/>
    longest covered bridge in the U.S.!!<br/>
(These stamps are all by the Jiggs Family and are really great boxes!)<br/>
Empire Mine--planted by Funhog in 2001, this is a great historic location for <br/>
    a day of discovery and a lovely picnic.<br/>
Folsom "Castle Park" Series--in the over-built town of Folsom, a man-made<br/>
    wetlands any birdlover would adore houses these 3 boxes beautifully <br/>
    carved by a newbie, Diana. Don't miss these!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!!<br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
but good impressions. Sir B<br/>
