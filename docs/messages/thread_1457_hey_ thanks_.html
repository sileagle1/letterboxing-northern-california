We really liked the Junkyard Dog one, too.  Glad that Shirley is<br>
getting some love.  It's a great location with a powerful history. <br>
It's even nicer when it isn't raining.  Thanks for the shoutout.<br>

I"m so glad you guys liked Junkyard Dog - I just love that place.<br>
<br>
Because of its location, I made the Atlasquest find requirement on Junkyard<br>
Dog higher than my usual zero, but if you're newer to the game (or just<br>
don't log your finds) and think you can nab a box in a public place without<br>
being spotted... shoot me an email.<br>
