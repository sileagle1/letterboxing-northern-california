These suggestions for SoCo only,...Marin a whole 'nother subject.  Camping <br>
in N Ca in February can be dicey.  But it can also be glorious.  Sometimes the <br>
best weather is in Feb at the coast, or it can be storming fiercely.  Gualala <br>
Campground and Salt Park Campgrounds are very nice.  <br>
Do a google search for Sonoma County Regional Parks, they have a nice <br>
website.    Several good boxes along Sonoma Coast and the St pat <br>
series(which I have not gotten yet, but saw the stamps..magnificent!) in <br>
Mendocino. I plan on planting 4 more boxes at the coast soon.<br>
<br>
Sugarloaf Ridge SP has alot of boxes and camping year round.  <br>
<br>
I think a detour to Valley of the Moon/hwy 12 for Glen Ellen / Kenwood boxes. <br>
then out 12 to coast for those boxes (Bodega north to Jenner, back the <br>
Russian River Rd to 101 north to Healdsburg for the quartet. ) and if brave <br>
can take skagg springs rd form Healdsburg out to sea ranch and back up the <br>
coast to Mendocino.  <br>
<br>
For kitsch definitely check out Holy Canoli Batman!  I am also planning a <br>
Syncline country stamp (I was a geology major in college)...but had not found <br>
a good place for it yet, your trip should nudge me in that direction.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Ooooo, sounds like it could be a great trip!<br>
