                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out yesterday to update this series in Alameda due to the fact that a new box <br/>
needed to be added!  So Year of the Dog is now in place, and Year of the Rooster has been <br/>
replaced, but in a new spot.  The series is now in a loop and I have identified hiding spots <br/>
for the next 2 "years" along the path, so I'm good to go for a while.  I had hoped to affix <br/>
Dog to a mailbox (it involvesa magnet) but there was not a single darn mailbox in all of <br/>
Bay Farm Island!  It was very weird - guess they are just too unsightly for those in the <br/>
planned communities to bear to look at.<br/>
