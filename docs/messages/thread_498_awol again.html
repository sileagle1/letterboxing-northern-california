 <br>
I took the day and went down to the Sac area. The following boxes are alive and well (and have seen a lot of traffic in January!):<br>
 <br>
Bucky's Feathered Friend--nice visit to the river, along with Bucky Beaver<br>
MK74 Mystery box--terrific clues, great spot, nice stamp. Congrats on your first box, Black Cavalier!<br>
Bucky Beaver<br>
Scoopy's Bee Hive--another great set of clues and nice stamp. I was faked out and took the wrong way first, and thought the box must be missing, then went the right way and found it! Two possible solutions, right to the end.<br>
 <br>
I planted a surprise in one of the above, brought back all the way from Georgia.<br>
