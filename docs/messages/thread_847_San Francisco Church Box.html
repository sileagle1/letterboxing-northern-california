&gt; I'm surprised artrekker found San Francisco Church. When I looked for <br/>
&gt; it. there was nothing to be found. <br/>
<br/>
We found the SF Church over the July 4th week-end and it was very wet<br/>
and sitting exposed right next to or on the sprinkler.  We dried it as<br/>
best we could.  Placed the log in a dry bag and doctored the box with<br/>
some camoflage tape and taped some ivy on it.  It was hidden quite<br/>
well when we left.  You may want to feel around with your foot.  We<br/>
notified the placers with our modifications.  They thanked us and<br/>
stated that they do not live in the area. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am AMAZED that this box is still alive and well - I was certain it <br/>
would go bye-bye within a week of its planting.  I don't believe the <br/>
placers are involved in LBing anymore.  Carole Kat you are a hero for <br/>
camouflaging the box - it definitely needed some help from an <br/>
experienced letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
I did make it to SF yesterday and put a new log book in my Buffalo box <br/>
and checked on Playland Lives - which does still live!!  The area is <br/>
somewhat overgrown but the box was snug in its niche.  I will try to <br/>
rewrite the clues again to help locate this elusive box.  While in the <br/>
city I was able to get 2 of Paul's boxes (while apparently he was <br/>
hiding ANOTHER ONE) - the Therapeutist and the Windy one.  I had some <br/>
difficulty at Ortus Depths because the place was CRAWLING with trail <br/>
volunteers.  They were from the Gap (matching t-shirts) and I think <br/>
there were 100s of them.  Literally.  I hunted around the best I could <br/>
but I never did find the Lions - but that might be because there were <br/>
volunteers blocking them from view.  Luckily I have Paul's new box and <br/>
the Tintin boxes to get me back into my beloved city soon.  However on <br/>
Friday I am off to New York for my birthday and then on to CT with <br/>
Amanda for some power boxing!  So I'll see y'all later!<br/>

Never mind, I figured out what I did wrong and now know where the Lions <br/>
are - guess it would have been pretty hard to miss them, if only I'd <br/>
been in the right place!  I was down by the natatorium - silly me.  By <br/>
the way, has anyone attempted Semper Fi lately?  It's down in that area <br/>
of town also.<br/>
