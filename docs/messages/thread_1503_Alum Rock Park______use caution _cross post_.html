I'm worried about Robb, who cannot move very quickly, and might be at<br>
particular risk.<br>

So, let's stick together, okay?<br>

If something threatens Robb, the group forms a defensive barrier around<br>
him, just like I saw the Prairie Dogs do on Animal Plant when they were<br>
protecting a mother & her young from hawks.<br>

BTW Lisa, if you haven't planted them yet, can you bring the stamps I<br>

Kathy--I'm sure CrowGirl could supply some Poodles, especially if some<br>
money was donated to her favorite animal rescue group.  However, I am<br>
concerned that the constant shrill yapping of the little beasts might<br>
in fact attract unwanted attention and precipitate an unpleasant<br>
encounter...<br>
<br>
--dorksanonymous, who does not have a better solution to ensure the<br>
safety of all involved on Sunday.<br>
