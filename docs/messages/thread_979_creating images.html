carving.  <br>
<br>
The more you actually draw your image, the more you *understand* it. <br>
Following what the photocopier or Photoshop gives you is less scary,<br>
in terms of drawing, but making choices about the realtionship of dark<br>
to light, line weight, and composition produces a more satisfying<br>
final image.  The more choices you make, the more you made the image<br>
your own (and you'll surely learn something in the process)!<br>
<br>
I tend to use all the tools in the toolbox.  I download images, I<br>
manipulate 'em, but then, I always draw on my carving material, so I<br>
understand what I'm about to "take a kife to."  And, I know better<br>
than to ever expect that I'll arrive at photo-realism with a slab of<br>
pink rubber and a couple of tiny knives!<br>
<br>
But that's just my aproach.  I have nothing but good things to say<br>
about my fellow Northern California carvers.  If I didn't think you<br>
guys were all amazing, I wouldn't be so eager to go hunting letterboxes!<br>
<br>
Cheers Y'all!<br>
