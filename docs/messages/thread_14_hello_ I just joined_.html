I am a recent letter boxing afficianado. Have only hunted 1 so far <br>
and made my husband (a desert/mtn photographer/treker) find 1.<br>
Spent a week in Massachusetts in October with my sister and turned <br>
her on to LB and we hunted several there. My favorites were the <br>
boxes in graveyards. There is a whole zodiac series, each box in a <br>
different graveyard. We hunted 2 of those. It may sound wierd, but I <br>
like the graveyards, they are very interesting, historical places.<br>
Will check back occasionally in the future.<br>
