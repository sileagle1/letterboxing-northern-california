oiled wildlife response team for the San Francisco Oil Spill. What an<br/>
undertaking!<br/>
<br/>
The center had almost five hundred birds in care, of which one hundred<br/>
and twenty five had been sufficiently stabilized to wash (washing a<br/>
bird is VERY stressful for a bird) and sadly, over three hundred other<br/>
birds were dead on arrival.<br/>
<br/>
You can read about this effort at<br/>
http://ibrrc.org/Cosco_Busan_spill_2007.html<br/>
<br/>
And if you are moved to do so, consider making a donation to this<br/>
effort. Hundred of professionals and volunteers are hard at work, but<br/>
all the food and treatments don't come cheap.<br/>

All the Best,<br/>
