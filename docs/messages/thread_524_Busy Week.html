Kel, <br/>
Glad to hear you and your mom made the loop and did so with daylight <br/>
leftover (or so it seems so).  Sorry about Pluto and the missing <br/>
stamp, next time I am up that way I will make a stamp for you. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the pitch/plea for more boxes here...actually I think all <br/>
the folk hear on the chat list should plant near where they live and I <br/>
need to somehow convince more local folk here to begin letterboxing <br/>
(Think Globally, act locally)   Hmm, Mesmerize people, buy a <br/>
billboard?  Send  a letter to the editor extolling the virtues of <br/>
letterboxing?  I guess you don't want to much exposure because it has <br/>
it's downside too...like teenage vandals, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
and it is working...look at Wascally Wabbit and Moonrabbit THANKS!  I <br/>
see I have two more boxes just south of me, I guess I know what I will <br/>
be doing this weekend.  But truth be told, I really like planting <br/>
boxes, more than finding them I think.  Stay tuned for A series based <br/>
on Rocky and Bullwinkle and a single box based on Shadow of A Doubt.  <br/>
(Another Hitchcock movie).    I feel a dry spell after that...at least <br/>
no more ideas in the pipelin ebeyond a PLB and the GRR stamp.  SO <br/>
mayber I will switch over to finding that.<br/>

<br/>
We had plenty of daylight, just no time. My mom was supposed to get to a rehearsal in Beverly Hillsburg (like my name for it? :&gt; ) at 4:00. We let go of her being on time, and then realized she wouldn't make it at all, but we were still moving along at a clip. I'll save the hummingbird and the wine country boxes for another time, and if I'm really motivated, I'll climb back up to Pluto. The Planet Walk does give you a great sense of relative distance in our solar system--all those planets clustered together at the beginning, then they get further and further out. We could almost feel the cold isolation! even though it was a beautiful day with perfect temperatures.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also sorry I didn't get to swing by and see you. I'll try to build it into a future trip. It just always seems like I run out of time so fast.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about wanting to lure people into Lbing in your area. I'm thinking of planting little cryptic notes here and there in Nevada--Carson City has great locations for boxes--to see if I can get any bites.<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks to Alien Explorers for Abamit &amp; her Shadow! Fun box, fun clues!<br/>
<br/>
Sierra Sally--glad to hear the lighthouse is alive and well. I'll have to try again next time I go see my sister.<br/>

The alien explorer who did this one (usually it's a joint effort with my<br/>
son, but this one was MINE!)<br/>
