Pearl Islands". Found 2 and 3  first and almost gave up, but during <br/>
a water break (HOT!!out there) just happened to look over and think-<br/>
could that be it?? and as luck would have it....  Beautiful area and <br/>
had nice drive and time at the beach after. Thanks again Lea. Im so <br/>
glad i've found letterboxing. Its so cool to have my kids getting <br/>
into something I enjoy. (My four year old "Lil' Bean" found box 3) <br/>
Also thanks to all for all the greetings and info/advice.<br/>
