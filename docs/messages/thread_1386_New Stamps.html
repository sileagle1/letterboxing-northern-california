the rope descent to Da Kool Kats' Tribal Letterbox (Waterfall #4).  <br/>
Not many people have ventured out for this treasure and we felt <br/>
privileged to find it.  <br/>
<br/>
We were disappointed by the rapidly deteriorating quality of our <br/>
stamp, so we spent this morning carving new ones.  We have replaced <br/>
our small stamps for boxes as well as our personal stamp for <br/>
exchanges.  You'll know the new ones by the hats the Grumpy Grinch now <br/>
wears.<br/>
