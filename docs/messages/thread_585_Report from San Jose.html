I was there for business, so I arrived on Friday night, worked all day on <br/>
Saturday in Sam Ramon, and then went down to San Jose on Saturday night to <br/>
stay with family. So I didn't really have much time before leaving at 6:30 <br/>
on Monday morning! But they did have fun letterboxing with me -- one of the <br/>
kids immediately recognized where The Egypt Game was by the clue, and even <br/>
had the inside scoop on how to interpret the hieroglyphics! (I had to do it <br/>
the old-fashioned way....) We'll have to see if they stick with it, but <br/>
they have their own handmade journals with their first finds and exchanges <br/>
and all those empty pages to tempt them....<br/>
<br/>
We did see your and Sleepy Cat's stamps in one of the other boxes we found <br/>
(Go Spartans, perhaps), and I made sure to point it out, and tell them that <br/>
you had planted The Egypt Game letterboxes, and that you were famous....<br/>
<br/>
