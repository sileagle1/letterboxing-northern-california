today found a circus camped on my doorstep!  Neeedless to say they<br>
were tired and hungry, and are currently snoring in the backyard<br>
encampment.  Mercy, they must travel by air these days, and had no<br>
hairgel or liquids to slow them down at airport security.<br>
<br>
I will escort them to BASS where I am sure everyone will be delighted<br>
by the spectacle they promise.<br>
