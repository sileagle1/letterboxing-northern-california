supposed to be set in Modesto?  I know they have a Graffiti Days <br>
festival there, and St. Stan's makes a specialty beer for the occasion. <br>
  Harrison Ford sure was dreamy in his pre-Han Solo days (okay, he was <br>
pretty cute as Han too - I guess someone named Princess Lea has to <br>
admit!)<br>

Congratulations to WAscally Wabbit on a job well done.  AMerican <br>
Graffiti is a great series and if I am not mistaken, it is this <br>
person's first plant and  carvings.  WW is quite talented! <br>
<br>
 I know from doing The Birds that movie clues can be really difficult <br>
to write and research so hats off to Paul in SF(for Vertigo #1, <br>
Psycho) , Princess Lea (VErtigo #2) and WW for these most enjoyable <br>
escapades.  <br>
