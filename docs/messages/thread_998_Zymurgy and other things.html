<br/>
The Monday after Xmas ws reltively dry so we took off for a day of <br/>
boxin gand visiting in SF.  We had a wonderful time visiting...in no <br/>
particular order so as not to give away hints: First Job, Last <br/>
worker...lots of great parking and surrounded by New Zealand <br/>
Christmas trees just beginnning to bloom..the red flowered <br/>
Pohutokawa tree! I saw Princess Lea, Sleepy CAt and Amanda had all <br/>
been there on the 24th and 25th.  It alswys bring s asmile to my <br/>
face when I see various folks personal stamps...like getting a wave <br/>
from a friend.  <br/>
<br/>
Euras, the East Wind....way cool stamp and location.  Also Harold <br/>
and Maude #3.  We got skunked with Boreas and Where the Buffalo <br/>
Roam.  I fear both those boxes may be MIA.  Unfortunately, it being <br/>
Monday, the shop housing Day of the Dead was closed...so that will <br/>
have to be another day.  Plus, I really gotta fingure out where <br/>
greener pastures lie...<br/>
<br/>
And what does a boxer do on rainy days...virtual boxes!  YOu can <br/>
search ATlasquest and generate a page of virtual boxes if you select <br/>
VB under the pulldown menu for box type.  I think you may be able to <br/>
do the same with LBNA site.  I would recommend the Kimball Library, <br/>
Mysterious Women, Famous Dragons, and Star War trivia boxes..but I <br/>
have plugged them before...lots of others.  <br/>
<br/>
As for home brew...Steve my DH has been homebrewing 15 plus years.  <br/>
IT all started bak in Toronto when he was a broke grad student and <br/>
sicovered he could make great beer for a fraction of the cost....we <br/>
made some root beer two weeks ago but unfortunately it is <br/>
flat...despite the champagne yeast we pitched in.  So it sounds like <br/>
letterboxing and beermaking go hand in hand.  Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of ideas of new boxes...and while in SF stopped in <br/>
Japantown to pick up some nonRubbermaid tupperware. Alas, when I got <br/>
home I discovered upon unwrapping it the lids are not watertight.  I <br/>
think the idea of reduce-re-use-recycle is a great one and hope to <br/>
be using more of the camotaped pb jars and such this year. I know da <br/>
Kool Kats are famous for this.  Adn they stay so dry inside! <br/>
<br/>
So are we going to have some kind of gathering on teh 14th?  I am <br/>
game!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Years to all. Mimulus<br/>
