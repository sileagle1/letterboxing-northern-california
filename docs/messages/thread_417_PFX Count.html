Hmmm. <br>
I guess I have never taken the time to count  my PF and X's.  <br>
Hopefully I can count better than I type, looking over my last posts <br>
I am embarrassed!  If only I had paid more attention in typing class <br>
back in High School.  Sister Davida would rap my knuckles if she saw <br>
such atrocious typing!<br>
<br>
Good luck with the Johnny Appleseeding in Louisiana BugZ, any boxes <br>
are better than none.  HOpe Grumpy Grinch is feeling better.  Hope <br>
ARttrekker and everyone else made it back safely.  <br>
<br>
Anyone up for another informal gathering in March or so?<br>

I had a great time at the event. Thank you to Princess Lea for her<br>
talk, to Blackbird for <br>
having the event in her classroom, and for showing us the<br>
Velociraptor skeleton she <br>
created, to the Kool Kats for the homemade cookies and for the HH I<br>
will drop off back <br>
east, and to everyone else who brought snacks, to arttrekker for<br>
showing us the calendar <br>
she created and for making a special event stamp, and to Anna, Alien<br>
Explorers, <br>
Cellisimo,Mimulus, Wascally Wabbit, Sleepycat, and Michelle for<br>
coming and sharing.<br>

Wahoo sent me an <br>
article about it)<br>
<br>
I'm currently working on a new stamp using tips I garnered from the<br>
event. I think it'll be <br>
kinda cool.<br>
<br>
Also thanks very much to princess lea for finding my first LB and for<br>
putting the plastic <br>
bag around it. :)<br>
