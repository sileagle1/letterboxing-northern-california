whole week in Feb.  I'll be dedicating 1 day to boxing &amp; at least<br/>
catching up on the new boxes in the Sac area.<br/>

	Eeeew! The stamps taste like pork???? In the immortal words of<br/>
Vincent from Project <br/>
	Runway - that is just pig!<br/>
<br/>
	I am almost ready for the next box in my Lunar New Year series -<br/>
Pig is about 3/4 carved <br/>
	and I already have a spot picked out. Looks like it doesn't get<br/>
started until 2/18 this year <br/>
	though - seems a little later than usual. Hmmm, wonder how I can<br/>
get *my* stamp to <br/>
	smell like pork..... No wait, that will attract unwanted<br/>
visitors, like vultures or something.<br/>
<br/>
	I have been on a carving jag the past couple of days. I finished<br/>
and replanted Sushi House <br/>
	and Survivor: The Amazon #3 (thought #4 might be missing too,<br/>
but I did find it alive and <br/>
	well). Got a stamp ready for my Girl Scout trip this weekend,<br/>
and have gotten a few ready <br/>
	for the April Fools gathering too. It sure is fun having free<br/>
time on my hands with no <br/>
	school work or job responsibilities!!<br/>
