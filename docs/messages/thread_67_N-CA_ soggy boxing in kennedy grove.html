Since it was such a gorgeous weekend, I went to try to get some <br>
boxes that I missed during the N. CA gathering last summer. <br>
<br>
#1 of Boxer family series - intact and dry<br>
Take a Hike - intact and dry.<br>
No Speed Zone #1: A Speed Limit - soaked and a little buggy.<br>
<br>
I took the No Speed Zone box home for a little TLC and sent an e-<br>
mail to A-Bear. I'll make a new log and replace with a more <br>
watertight box hopefully next weekend. Unfortunately I didn't have <br>
time to check on #2 of this series.<br>
