think it would be nice to invite all the folks who came to the Northern California event <br>
in September to whichever group.  There was a lot of enthusiasm at the time, but not <br>
many letterboxes have developed from that get-together.  I see that my cohorts of <br>
the day, DoubleSaj and Miss Vickie are already on this list.  I think DSaj has the <br>
questionnaires where people indicated their email addresses.  I have a list somewhere <br>
too.....  <br>
