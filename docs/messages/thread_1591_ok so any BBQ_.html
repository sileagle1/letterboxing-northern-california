I'm so excited about seeing my letterboxing friends, both my old<br>
friends, and the ones I haven't had the chance to meet, yet!<br>

<br>
I wish I could be there, but I'm on crutches with a fractured hip, and I <br>
won't be in town this weekend anyway.  On top of all that I'm preparing to <br>
move back into my house after having been displaced for over a month due <br>
to a house fire, and I don't have any of my 'boxing gear available to me <br>
right now anyway. :(<br>
<br>
I hope you all have a fantastic time, and I hope there's another gathering <br>
soon!<br>

There's also a gathering in Orange County in October if you're inclined <br>
to take a trip down south. :)<br>
