(sorry if you get this more than once, it's a multiple post)<br>
<br>
We are traveling to Phoenix this Christmas and would love your suggestions<br>
on not-to-be missed letterboxes.  Here's our expected letterboxing<br>
locations/route:<br>
- Ashland<br>
- Drive-bys on I-5 between Medford and LA area <br>
- Redding<br>
-Sacramento<br>
-Oakland<br>
-Santa Clarita<br>
-Palm Springs<br>
-drive-bys on 1-10<br>
-Phoenix<br>
-Tucson<br>
-Flagstaff/Sedona/Laughlin/Lake Havasu (weather permitting)<br>
-Santa Barbara<br>
-drive-bys on 101 from LA to San Jose <br>
<br>
We REALLY appreciate your suggestions and/or comments even if it's your own<br>
boxes.  We each know our own boxes the best, right? Knowing which ones are<br>
missing is particularly helpful when you're traveling with limited time.   <br>
Of course we want to see some highlights in these areas - it's not ALL about<br>
F-count!  :-)<br>
  <br>
Time is of the essence - we leave the 19th.  Sorry . . . things have gotten<br>
away from me (as you may imagine, getting ready for Christmas AND a<br>
letterboxing trip like this is overwhelming).  We expect to have internet<br>
access occasionally along the way so we could get your response even after<br>
the 19th.<br>
<br>
A gracious thank you and a very Merry Christmas to you!<br>
Kurious Jo & Wood-aug<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I didn't see a response on this list, so I'll give you a quick review.<br>
Unfortunately, I've been inactive in letterboxing for almost a year, so<br>
don't know the current status on most of these boxes.  I can at least<br>
give you a quick overview of them.<br>
 <br>
Sacramento County<br>
Bounce Bounce - Elk Grove, nice drive by in a city park, good stop off<br>
if you have kids that need to burn off energy.  duck & geese demand<br>
entrance fee of bread.  close to the highway, but I think it's 99 & not<br>
I-5<br>
Fair Oaks - Fair Oaks, nice walk along the river, probably up to an hour<br>
if from car & back.  kind of close to freeway, but off Hwy 50, in the<br>
eastern portion of the Sacramento area<br>
Folsom Powerhouse - Folsom, nice 10 min walk along river.  historic<br>
site, so sometimes closed, further east than Fair Oaks<br>
Folsom Prison - Folsom, easy drive by, off the back of a small city park<br>
(chickens dont demand entrance fee).  <br>
Old Sac Mini-Series - Downtown Sac (right off I-5), i thougth these were<br>
pulled after our Gold Rush Romp event in Apr 2005, but according the<br>
note on lb.org clues, they're still there.  Old Sac is a good place to<br>
get a number of driveby boxes.<br>
Wayward Salmon - Rancho Cordova, haven't gotten this one, but a ways off<br>
Hwy 50, so might be kind of out of the way <br>
Ladybug Pool House - Rancho Cordova, this is a tricky one, it's in the<br>
middle of an apartment complex, & even though some of the residents<br>
nearby know about it, it's tough to be discrete.  cool since it was<br>
planted by little kids.  not too far off hwy 50.<br>
Scout Pack 302 - The Wolf Trail, Rancho Cordova, this would probably<br>
take about 30+ min from car & back.  large wilderness area.  same area<br>
as Riverside Ramble & Bucky's Feathered Friend, so can do those at same<br>
time.  planted by a Cub Scout pack.  10-15 min off hwy 50.<br>
Bucky's Feathered Friend - probably about 1 hour walk along river just<br>
for this one (not doing Scout Pack or Riverside Ramble)<br>
Riverside Ramble - 2+ hour walk through wilderness area.  spent most of<br>
an afternoon trying this one, but it was because a couple of the boxes<br>
had gone missing & i spent a long time looking for them.<br>
Scout Pack + Bucky's Feathered Friend + Riverside Ramble - probably<br>
about 2-3 hours if you do them all together.  nice afternoon out.  Fair<br>
Oaks box is also close (further up river), but probably not within<br>
walking distance.<br>
Brannan Duck - don't know, haven't gotten this one.<br>
Natomas Oaks - quick drive, but someone reported they'd tried it twice &<br>
hadn't found it.  i went out & wasn't able to find it, but was trying to<br>
do it from memory, so might not have been looking in right place.  <br>
GRR Strike It Rich - 2 of 3 in the series missing, dont know about 3rd,<br>
in Old Sac<br>
Scoopy's Bee Hive - Drive by in downtown Sacramento.<br>
U-Neak Pig - In Old Sac, still around<br>
Sacramento Parents Magazine #1 - right off Business 80, in the middle of<br>
a kids playground, so tough to be sneaky.  my daughter plays there all<br>
the time & I haven't gotten it since there's always too many kids.<br>
OTOH, with all the kids, I wouldn't be surprised if it's gone.<br>
Gold Rush Romp Series - in Old Sac.  <br>
Old Sac Landmark Series - in Old Sac (obviously).  Told you there were a<br>
lot in Old Sac.  If you have kids, make sure to get the Bit O Heaven box<br>
1st so they can run off all the sugar.O<br>
Old Sac - in Old Sac, I thought this was missing long ago, but it shows<br>
as found in Oct.<br>
Bucky Beaver- Rancho Cordova, another one along the river, but at a<br>
differet spot than the others above.  probably 30+ min from car & back,<br>
walk along the river.  <br>
 <br>
LB.Org also lists the Sacramento Historic City Cemetary box in the<br>
"basement" section.  I'm not sure if that means there's been on activity<br>
for a long time, or if it's officially been retired or abandoned.  But,<br>
it's a cool cemetary & pretty much a drive by.  The cemetary is only<br>
open during certain times during the day, but I know there's a website<br>
for it since they provide guided history tours through it.<br>
 <br>
The only other site I can comment on is the Hog Heaven Theme Park.  This<br>
looks to be the largest concentration of boxes at a single site anywhere<br>
in California.  I don't know what the rain will have done to the site,<br>
but it's definately an all (or at least most of the) day hunt.  & a<br>
walking stick & kneepads are strongly recommended.  it's a plateau of<br>
broken rocks, so I serious banged up my knees a number of times falling<br>
& even tore my jeans.  But, experience, both in the hunt, the boxes, the<br>
hiding, & the clues, shouldn't be missed if possible.<br>
 <br>
& let me know when you're in Sacramento, maybe we could meet up for an<br>
exchange.<br>
 <br>
Hope this helps,<br>
Black Cavalie<br>

  if from car & back. kind of close to freeway, but off Hwy 50, in the<br>
  eastern portion of the Sacramento area<br>
  Folsom Powerhouse - Folsom, nice 10 min walk along river. historic<br>
  site, so sometimes closed, further east than Fair Oaks<br>
  Folsom Prison - Folsom, easy drive by, off the back of a small city park<br>
  (chickens dont demand entrance fee).<br>
  Old Sac Mini-Series - Downtown Sac (right off I-5), i thougth these were<br>
  pulled after our Gold Rush Romp event in Apr 2005, but according the<br>
  note on lb.org clues, they're still there. Old Sac is a good place to<br>
  get a number of driveby boxes.<br>
  Wayward Salmon - Rancho Cordova, haven't gotten this one, but a ways off<br>
  Hwy 50, so might be kind of out of the way<br>
  Ladybug Pool House - Rancho Cordova, this is a tricky one, it's in the<br>
  middle of an apartment complex, & even though some of the residents<br>
  nearby know about it, it's tough to be discrete. cool since it was<br>
  planted by little kids. not too far off hwy 50.<br>
  Scout Pack 302 - The Wolf Trail, Rancho Cordova, this would probably<br>
  take about 30+ min from car & back. large wilderness area. same area<br>
  as Riverside Ramble & Bucky's Feathered Friend, so can do those at same<br>
  time. planted by a Cub Scout pack. 10-15 min off hwy 50.<br>
  Bucky's Feathered Friend - probably about 1 hour walk along river just<br>
  for this one (not doing Scout Pack or Riverside Ramble)<br>
  Riverside Ramble - 2+ hour walk through wilderness area. spent most of<br>
  an afternoon trying this one, but it was because a couple of the boxes<br>
  had gone missing & i spent a long time looking for them.<br>
  Scout Pack + Bucky's Feathered Friend + Riverside Ramble - probably<br>
  about 2-3 hours if you do them all together. nice afternoon out. Fair<br>
  Oaks box is also close (further up river), but probably not within<br>
  walking distance.<br>
  Brannan Duck - don't know, haven't gotten this one.<br>
  Natomas Oaks - quick drive, but someone reported they'd tried it twice &<br>
  hadn't found it. i went out & wasn't able to find it, but was trying to<br>
  do it from memory, so might not have been looking in right place.<br>
  GRR Strike It Rich - 2 of 3 in the series missing, dont know about 3rd,<br>
  in Old Sac<br>
  Scoopy's Bee Hive - Drive by in downtown Sacramento.<br>
  U-Neak Pig - In Old Sac, still around<br>
  Sacramento Parents Magazine #1 - right off Business 80, in the middle of<br>
  a kids playground, so tough to be sneaky. my daughter plays there all<br>
  the time & I haven't gotten it since there's always too many kids.<br>
  OTOH, with all the kids, I wouldn't be surprised if it's gone.<br>
  Gold Rush Romp Series - in Old Sac.<br>
  Old Sac Landmark Series - in Old Sac (obviously). Told you there were a<br>
  lot in Old Sac. If you have kids, make sure to get the Bit O Heaven box<br>
  1st so they can run off all the sugar.O<br>
  Old Sac - in Old Sac, I thought this was missing long ago, but it shows<br>
  as found in Oct.<br>
  Bucky Beaver- Rancho Cordova, another one along the river, but at a<br>
  differet spot than the others above. probably 30+ min from car & back,<br>
  walk along the river.<br>
<br>
  LB.Org also lists the Sacramento Historic City Cemetary box in the<br>
  "basement" section. I'm not sure if that means there's been on activity<br>
  for a long time, or if it's officially been retired or abandoned. But,<br>
  it's a cool cemetary & pretty much a drive by. The cemetary is only<br>
  open during certain times during the day, but I know there's a website<br>
  for it since they provide guided history tours through it.<br>
<br>
  The only other site I can comment on is the Hog Heaven Theme Park. This<br>
  looks to be the largest concentration of boxes at a single site anywhere<br>
  in California. I don't know what the rain will have done to the site,<br>
  but it's definately an all (or at least most of the) day hunt. & a<br>
  walking stick & kneepads are strongly recommended. it's a plateau of<br>
  broken rocks, so I serious banged up my knees a number of times falling<br>
  & even tore my jeans. But, experience, both in the hunt, the boxes, the<br>
  hiding, & the clues, shouldn't be missed if possible.<br>
<br>
  & let me know when you're in Sacramento, maybe we could meet up for an<br>
  exchange.<br>
<br>
  Hope this helps,<br>

  Hi all!<br>
  (sorry if you get this more than once, it's a multiple post)<br>
<br>
  We are traveling to Phoenix this Christmas and would love your<br>
  suggestions<br>
  on not-to-be missed letterboxes. Here's our expected<br>
  letterboxing<br>
  locations/route:<br>
  - Ashland<br>
  - Drive-bys on I-5 between Medford and LA area<br>
  - Redding<br>
  -Sacramento<br>
  -Oakland<br>
  -Santa Clarita<br>
  -Palm Springs<br>
  -drive-bys on 1-10<br>
  -Phoenix<br>
  -Tucson<br>
  -Flagstaff/Sedona/Laughlin/Lake Havasu (weather permitting)<br>
  -Santa Barbara<br>
  -drive-bys on 101 from LA to San Jose<br>
<br>
  We REALLY appreciate your suggestions and/or comments even if<br>
  it's your own<br>
  boxes. We each know our own boxes the best, right? Knowing which<br>
  ones are<br>
  missing is particularly helpful when you're traveling with<br>
  limited time.<br>
  Of course we want to see some highlights in these areas - it's<br>
  not ALL about<br>
  F-count! :-)<br>
<br>
  Time is of the essence - we leave the 19th. Sorry . . . things<br>
  have gotten<br>
  away from me (as you may imagine, getting ready for Christmas<br>
  AND a<br>
  letterboxing trip like this is overwhelming). We expect to have<br>
  internet<br>
  access occasionally along the way so we could get your response<br>
  even after<br>
  the 19th.<br>
<br>
  A gracious thank you and a very Merry Christmas to you!<br>
  Kurious Jo & Wood-aug<br>
