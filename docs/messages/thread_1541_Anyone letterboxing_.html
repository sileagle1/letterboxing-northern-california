Johnny Cash box, but then he decided he wanted to bring his wife &amp; baby,<br/>

Turns out the wife's parents are alleged letterboxers, but I'm still<br/>
thinking he's getting it mixed up with GeoCaching.  He said the<br/>
father-in-law would probably go under the trail name of "Inigo" (as in<br/>
"You killed my father, prepare to die").  Anyone seen that name out<br/>
there?<br/>

Still planning on trying for Johhny Cash box during lunch some time<br/>

webdesign stuff lately, which is sort of an alternative craft hobby for <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you interested in the Silver Pendant stuff I mentioned a <br/>
while back, would any of you maybe be interested in having a small craft <br/>
afternoon, ala the Eggstravaganza put on so wonderfully by Lisa and Robb? <br/>
I would teach you hands-on how to make your own silver pendants with your <br/>
own hand-carved design, instead of making them for you.  You would go home <br/>
with your pendant that day.<br/>
<br/>
If there's enough interest, and someone with more space can host, I'd <br/>
commit to gathering supplies and hauling my kiln somewhere for an <br/>
afternoon.  There'd be a fee for supplies, and I'd prefer to teach a small <br/>
group of about 5-6 - this ensures that everyone gets attention and that <br/>
there's time for everyone's work to be completed for same-day take-home. <br/>
I'd be willing to teach a group as small as 2-3 if there was interest from <br/>
only a few people.<br/>
<br/>
This way, you can get your carve on in a small way and not actually have <br/>
to plant a box. :)<br/>

Crafting ahoy?<br/>

&gt; I'd be willing to teach a group as small as 2-3 if there was interest from <br/>
&gt; only a few people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This way, you can get your carve on in a small way and not actually have <br/>

Hey all--<br/>
<br/>
We've actually been 'boxing most weekends although not necessarily getting "quantity". There've been a lot of plants in the Sacramento area and we've gotten quite a few of them. <br/>
<br/>
We have a 7-box series carved and ready to plant and have been scoping out a great place. Happy to say, last weekend, Old Blue found JUST the spot (while I was on a quilting retreat in Mt. Shatsa) and we're planning to plant it next weekend. Keep your eyes open for our post.<br/>
<br/>
Lea: we've been thinking of you so much lately with all the Nancy Drew movie chatter! Have a GREAT time with Amanda and all the other sleuths in So. Cal!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for checking in with all of us! I'm so glad I got to see everyone<br/>
in San Jose, 'cuz it's been the full-tilt work boogie ever since. No<br/>
boxing on any horizon, although Tahoe will be having boxing visitors<br/>
the last couple of weeks of June, so I'll do a little tour-guiding.<br/>
I've been getting up at 5 am the last 6 and a half weeks, literally<br/>
working my ass off (I'm a third of the way to my weight-loss goal),<br/>
trying to get in shape to climb Whitney with friends over Labor Day<br/>
weekend. I'd better get carving if I'm going to leave something up<br/>
there for Ryan and Miss Piggy, the hard-core hikers. :-)<br/>

Hey, what happened to the Letterboxing Cruise? I was "cruising" the<br/>
events list several weeks ago and noted with envy some of our friends<br/>
signed up to go to sea a'boxing. But it seems to have dropped off the<br/>
radar.<br/>

The chatter has calmed down since Mark and Sue Pepe started a chat <br/>
list on LBNA for those who have booked the cruise.  The info page is <br/>
linked from the Pepe's blog on Atlas Quest.  I believe there is a <br/>
little over a week left to guarantee a spot on the ship.  We will be <br/>
aboard but haven't noticed any other West Coast Boxers signed up yet.<br/>
