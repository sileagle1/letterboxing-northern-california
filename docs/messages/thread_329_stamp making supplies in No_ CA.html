Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any stores in northern CA that offer decent stamp making/carving <br/>
materials? I've been to several Michael's, Beverly's and Jo-Ann stores and haven't found <br/>
anything but fairly basic carving supplies (x-acto knives) and erasers. I know I can buy the <br/>
PZ cut and other soft carving blocks online, but I was wondering if anyone had any <br/>
suggestions regarding actual stores I might visit? (I'm working on creating my first box!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

aka RedinSF<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I am interested in any stamp carving demonstration/gathering that might occur. I <br/>
appreciate those of you who have brainstormed regarding this and those who have offered <br/>
meeting space ideas. Mimulus' classroom in the east bay sounds like a good place - most <br/>
people would only have to travel over 1 bridge or less (instead of 2 for those of us on the <br/>
peninsula heading to Sacto etc).<br/>

I went  to University Art in Sac (there are stores in<br/>
Palo Alto, San Jose, San Francisco &amp; Sac) and found a<br/>
nice selection of supplies. They carry Speedy-Stamp<br/>
and Speedy-Cut made by Speedball, also MasterCarve<br/>
made by Staedtler. I tend to prefer the first two<br/>
products. MasterCarve is really thick and I don't<br/>
think it carves that much more easily that the others,<br/>
but it's great to get some of each and experiment.<br/>
University Art also carries carving tools.<br/>

We buy most of our stuff at the Art Store on broadway in Oakland <br/>
(kind of near the Kaiser end of broadway)  we bought our speedball <br/>
lino tools there and also all sizes incl. 5x7 of the pink stuff <br/>
(speedy stamp, don't have it close right now) and the white stuff <br/>
(hated the white stuff, too crumbly)  good luck!  Cathi (punkinheads)<br/>

Sounds like you've already gotten some good info on places to shop. However, I want <br/>
to put in my two cents worth regarding media. I think Speedy Cut is terrible! It <br/>
crumbles and chips like crazy, very different from Mastercarve. Not all Mastercarve is <br/>
thick. I use the 1/2" 4X4 blocks. Plus, if all you can find is the 3/4" one, you can slice <br/>
it in half with a sharp knife and make two perfectly good pieces. <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, if you live somewhere where you don't have access to a good art supply <br/>
store, you can always find a Pink Pearl eraser and an exacto knife! Der Mad Stamper, <br/>
famed early letterboxer, actually prefers these tools! http://members.aol.com/<br/>
Letterboxr/stamps.html  When he goes boxing, he wears a fishing vest with his <br/>
carving stuff in various pockets. Always ready to go! Funhog<br/>
