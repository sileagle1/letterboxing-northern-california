                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've had several notifications that the box and stamp is missing from<br/>
the Eastern Waterfall Series Box #4 (Tribal Falls).  Gary Kat carved<br/>
another stamp, just in case, and we headed out to check on the all of<br/>
the falls boxes.  We found that the first 3 boxes, Bridal Veil Falls,<br/>
Horsetail Falls and Bassi Falls are as they should be; in place and<br/>
snug and dry.<br/>
<br/>
But, Tribal Falls had indeed disappeared!  It has now been replaced. <br/>
I'm not sure that those of you that tried for it once and did not find<br/>
the box will want to try for it again, although, I was able to do it<br/>
wearing a surgical walking boot this time and can only walk on my<br/>
heel.  No pressure on the toes!<br/>
<br/>
We tied another rope to the log that has fallen across the path to aid<br/>
in reaching the knotted rope for the descent. This should make it<br/>
easier and safer as long as other visitors leave it in place.<br/>
<br/>
Tribal Falls is not for children under 10-12 years range.<br/>
<br/>
Tribal Falls is the only one that is difficult, although it is the<br/>
shortest hike.  Those of you who have tried for this one and did not<br/>
find the box, don't expect the other falls boxes to be the same. <br/>
Don't let your attempt at the Tribal Falls box stop you from visiting<br/>
the other boxes in this series.  The other 3 boxes are easy in<br/>
comparison and Bassi and Horsetail are beautiful areas.<br/>
