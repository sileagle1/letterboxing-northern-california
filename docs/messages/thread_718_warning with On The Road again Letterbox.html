                    <div class="plaintext-content">hey all, just got a message from a leterboxer that attempted to find<br>
our On The Road Again<br>
at the Welcome Centre in Anderson California, they had the right spot,<br>
but couldn't find the box.<br>
(It had been  found midApril)<br>
as they searched the daughter felt something scaley, shone a<br>
flashlight in the spot,<br>
and there was a snake sleeping.<br>
I have no idea what type.<br>
so who knows<br>
perhaps the snake made off with the box?<br>
So if anyone is going to be near there, perhaps you too could check,<br>
with caution, of course.<br>
It is an orphan<br>
oh oh wait a minute,<br>
didn't someone else encounter a snake guarding another box a while back?? <br>
hhmm, perhaps the snakes of America are starting their own game of<br>
'protecting letterboxes'?<br>
hmmm, stranger things have happened...<br>
