If you haven't been to Atlas Quest latley and seen, I have renamed the <br>
Gathering in Vacaville. WARNING: you may have to do some research <br>
before coming. There will be a whole series planted on the Hound of <br>
the Baskervilles. The Gathering is on October 7th, bring boxes to <br>
plant, or plant early and bring clues. We already have 17 people <br>
signed up. It is potluck so  could everyone let me know what you are <br>
planning to bring. It is in Lagoon Valley Park, there is a parking fee <br>
of, I think $3, but it may be 5. If you have questions please let me <br>
know. I look forward to meeting you all.<br>

Mystery boxes usually don't list a starting point, but at a gathering<br>
wouldn't we all know the starting point?<br>
Thanks! <br>
I'm just a little bit confuddled :p<br>

Most mystery boxes are as you say not known where they are to start <br>
with, but there is also the ones that use chipers for the clues once <br>
you get to the starting location. This will be the case for you guys <br>
for the ones that I plant. Then when I post them to AQ they will be <br>
compleatly chipered. Am I making sense?<br>
