Come on over to Oakland, and we'll show you a good time!<br>
<br>
Actually, that invitation holds true for anyone in this group.<br>
<br>
Sadly, I'm unlikely to make it to NY this summer, but of course Lock Wench and <br>
Knitica will be there, as well as all the other wonderful Central New Yorkers.  <br>
It seems that the bulk of my NY letterboxes made it throught the winter <br>
uninjured -- Knitica is reporting in as she checks them.  <br>
<br>
Let me know what your schedule is...<br>
