                    <div class="plaintext-content">Old Blue and I had a lovely weekend to commemorate 2 years of boxing. <br>
Got 11 plus the Campfire HH! The following are alive and well:<br>
"Frogs Legs" and "A Dreidel for Charles" both by Caitlin,(we were <br>
first finders of the latter!) <br>
The Whisky letterbox series by DVN2RCKR is a good one! Found "Glory <br>
Hole" near an eeriely poignient audio message pole with the voice of <br>
JKF commemorating the site, recorded 2 months before his death. A <br>
really amazing experience. Found the Campfire HH here! Also got the <br>
second box, "Whiskey Town" (a great stamp so worth the long-ish <br>
trek!!) but heard #3 was missing so didn't go for it.<br>
<br>
DVN2RCKR's "Queen City Shasta" box is a must see, in the adorable and <br>
very well preserved town of Shasta, a few miles west of Redding. Well <br>
worth a visit. You can get the State Park Stamp at the State Park <br>
Office across the street from the stamp too.<br>
<br>
Funhog's "Roadside Rest" is a wonderful 2 sided stamp but her "Pax" <br>
box is in such an amazing place, you really must journey the 12 miles <br>
north of Weed to experience it. A Living Memorial Sculpture Garden <br>
you won't soon forget. <br>
<br>
Also found Gold Hill by Candi. Nice walk, even in the rain! HAPPY <br>
BOXING!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  It's great to hear the Whiskey Gold rush! box is alive & <br>
well!  I was starting to think it was a goner because nobody had <br>
ever said they'd found it.  It was, by far, the best stamp in the <br>
series.  Glory Hole was rather weak as it was based on my Mom's <br>
verbal description of what it was--I carved it before I got there <br>
and didn't have my 'kit' on me to carve a more representative stamp <br>
while I was there.  I haven't had the opportunity to get back there <br>
in a LONG while to replace it so that task still looms overhead.  I <br>
wonder--were the eagles nesting there again this year?  Usually <br>
indicated by the fact that many a hiking trail is closed so they <br>
can 'play'.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the heads up on these boxes.  As for the falls box, it <br>
was a spectacular site even without a stamp.  It was one of <br>
those 'secrets' I stumbled upon in my 'eavesdrop' mode and I was so <br>
glad I learned about it--an absolutely incredible spot!!!<br>
<br>
See you on the trails,<br>

You say there was 1 P? Can't wait to see the clues!!<br>

Sorry your hunt was not as fruitful as you would have liked. . .<br>
