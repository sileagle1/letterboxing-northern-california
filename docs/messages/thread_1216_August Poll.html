&gt;  Mid to late August would be either the weekend of the 19th/20th or the<br/>
&gt;  25th/26th. More people seemed to be available overall in mid-August <br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt;  I'd be willing to do another poll, or if you just want to post yes/no,<br/>
&gt;  that's fine too.<br/>
&gt;  Would it be safe to start encouraging those of you who said you'd <br/>
&gt; plant to<br/>
&gt;  start carving now? :)<br/>
