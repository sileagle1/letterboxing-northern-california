<br>
We've been out of letterboxing for almost 2 years, and it doesn't look like we're coming <br>
back. We just don't have time to do it without our son's participation and he is no longer <br>
interested.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, we discovered that not only is Alien Lost, the whole series is lost. Sad about <br>
that one - our first planting.<br>
<br>
Abamit and her shadow is also lost.<br>
<br>
The Greatest Liar has only 2 boxes left as far as we know, #'s 1 & 2.<br>
<br>
We don't know about any of our others. If anyone knows, let us know. Please email me <br>
directly as I'm on "no email" for this list due to our lack of involvement.<br>
<br>
I updated our letterboxing.org listings, and the one that's listed on atlasquest i think is <br>
still alive and well. hope so, anyway. <br>
<br>
If someone wants to adopt any of our boxes, please do - and let us know.<br>
<br>
Hope you're all enjoying yourselves!<br>
<br>
