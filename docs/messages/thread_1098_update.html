We have been praying for Robb's quick recovery.  It sounds like prayers <br/>
and well wishes are helping!  Tell him to keep up the hard work and I'm <br/>

Thanks for all your good thoughts...We had a bit of a scare Tuesday<br/>
when the fire got very close to the Gardner Mountain residential area<br/>
(see new map--across from nursery) and was bearing down on the nursery<br/>
as well. I went by yesterday; all is well for the moment. Seems kind<br/>
of windy this morning. Here's a link to a site about the groovy helitanker<br/>
that has been flying over my house, dousing hot spots in very steep areas:<br/>
http://www.ericksonaircrane.com/servicedetail.asp?ServiceName=Firefighting<br/>
(go to the photo gallery). No smoke now on this whole side of the burn--<br/>
so you can see the burn area now, but not where it is currently burning.<br/>
I think they still have the area where the nursery is on alert. I hope they<br/>
can keep it away from Camp Rich, Fallen Leaf Lake, Tallac Historic Site.<br/>
Hoo boy, too much history in those sites to lose.<br/>

We are all well at the moment and considering ourselves fortunate.<br/>

Thanks for the shout! We're in good shape. We still haven't seen<br/>
the nearby site of devastation yet (where all the houses burned),<br/>
so that will probably be a shock. But considering what this could<br/>
have been, we are so fortunate. Say hi to all the RM boxers for me!<br/>
