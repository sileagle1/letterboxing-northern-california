                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I promised news soon about our August gathering.  I'd like to go ahead and<br/>
finalize the date as Sunday, August 27!  I'm also going to take Doublesaj<br/>
&amp; Old Blue's excellent suggestion and call this the LbNCA Dog Days<br/>
Gathering!  Thanks for the great name.<br/>
<br/>
As for the location - I was set to make a reservation at Redwood Regional<br/>
for us, but then Lisa wrote me to tell about this other fantastic park in<br/>
Oakland that looks very scenic, inspiring, and accessible, among many<br/>
other desirable features.  It has shoreline and estuary, views of the bay<br/>
and San Francisco, many paths, picnic tables with BBQ pit, no fees, clean<br/>
restrooms, and more.  It's called Middle Harbor Shoreline Park and is in<br/>
Oakland, right on the bay (cool breezes!):<br/>
<br/>
http://www.ebparks.org/parks/midlhar.htm<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone object to moving the gathering here?  I think Redwood is also<br/>
great, but Lisa's description of MHSP to me was glowing and the idea of it<br/>
is very inspiring.  I'll definitely reserve a spot in one or the other<br/>
next week; if I hear no objections, I'll reserve at MHSP.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, 13 of you said in the poll that you could help with organization<br/>
if asked.  Also, 11 of you said you'd be interested in a potluck, with two<br/>
of you indicating interest in BBQ.  Can one or two of you 13 potential<br/>
volunteers contact me offlist, to help coordinate the potluck list (and<br/>
with potential availability in BBQ, anyone who wants to run that)?  I'll<br/>
also need someone to help coordinate the letterbox planting/clue gathering<br/>
efforts.<br/>
<br/>
So, put it in your calendar now: August 27, LbNCA Dog Days Gathering!  Who<br/>
would like to carve the event stamp? :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The one thing I forgot to mention is that the Middle Harbor Park is<br/>
fairly "wide open."  Not a lot of trees of rocks.  But steel<br/>
structures!  Whoo boy do they have steel structures.  If you've got<br/>
magnetic letterboxes in mind, this place is a planter's paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, it is really really wheelchair friendly.  While Redwood had a<br/>
nice picnic area where Robb could hang out, this park has two miles of<br/>
nice flat paved trails from one end to the other.<br/>
<br/>
There's a sandy beach (with loads of driftwood), views of the bay<br/>
bridge and San Francisco, a lookout tower (with elevators), barbeque<br/>
areas, many immaculate restrooms, odd public art, and it is literally<br/>
under the feet of the giant "horsies" of the Port of Oakland.  The<br/>
Port of Oakland paid for the whole project, and you can see that a lot<br/>
of thought and $$$ went into this place.<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell that I was pretty jazzed when I finally got off my butt<br/>
and drove down to check out that strip of green on the Oakland map?<br/>

for the enthusiastic push to get us all started.  We love the Dog Days <br/>

We are tied up with a family wedding through Aug. 20th, but hope to <br/>
help with the preparations and/or set-up.  <br/>

<br/>
I'm back from my trip to the Pacific Northwest and catching up on the events of the last <br/>
few days.  I'm sorry to be a wet blanket, but I don't think that Middle Harbor is a good <br/>
choice for the gathering based on the lack of hiding spots for boxes.  It's actually <br/>
surprising to me that Redwood Park doesn't have more boxes as it is ideal for hiding.  I <br/>
was planning on leaving boxes at the gathering permanently, but if we have it at Middle <br/>
Harbor, I probably would not leave boxes there.  Also, maybe we should consider other <br/>
names for the event if someone else is already doing a Dog Days.  Depending on where we <br/>
go, we could incorprate the word "harbor" or "redwood."<br/>
<br/>
As for volunteering, I would be happy to help with logistics and "letterbox organizing," <br/>
although in the past it has basically been a free-for-all, with people just bringing their <br/>
clues on the day of the event.<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, I couldn't remember if we had discussed it on this list or not (I thought <br/>
we had, but DoubleSaj didn't think so), but would others be interested in having a <br/>
Northern California letterboxing patch?  The one for the Pacific Northwest group of a slug <br/>
with an umbrella is so darn cute!  This might be a fun thing to have ready in time for the <br/>
August event.  <br/>

P.S.  I was a classic major for about a millisecond and have taken several Latin and Ancient <br/>
Greek classes.  Never thought they'd actually come in handy!<br/>
