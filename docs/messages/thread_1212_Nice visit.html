<br/>
I had the wonderful opportunity to meet Elisabeth of the Buppsters<br/>
down fomr Tacoma, WA to help with her neice's grad night (isn;t that<br/>
awesome that she would do that?)<br/>
<br/>
We just had tea and coffee and shared stories and logbooks..but I<br/>
wanted to rave about a particular stamp she had fomr the portland, OR<br/>
area.  <br/>
Called letterboox<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=19573&amp;boxname=Letterboox<br/>
by DoubleTree, it was teh most amzing carving I ever seen.  I made<br/>
amentla note to someday make it up there to collect that stamp, you<br/>
might want to do the same. The rest is s surprise.  <br/>
