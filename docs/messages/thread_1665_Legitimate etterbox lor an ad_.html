Doesn't seem like there is any embedded clue there - just an ad.  Drag.<br/>
<br/>
I had a good time tracking down East to West today in San Jose (okay,<br/>
Los Gatos) - I was surprised by how many intrepid souls have made it<br/>
up that big hill!  I thought it hit the Triple Play of letterboxing:<br/>
clever clues, good location and gorgeous stamp.  Bravo to Wassa &amp;<br/>
Chunna!  <br/>
<br/>
Also thanks for meeting me for lunch Wassa!  We discovered a yummy<br/>
Cajun place downtown after trying to locate Maybe Next Year - I think<br/>
it was my 4th attempt!  But this time, The Master confirmed it<br/>
missing.  Boo hoo.  Maybe Next Time...<br/>
