You mention Sako in your post. Can you tell me if your Sako planted <br>
the original "Succulent Box" letterbox in the Los Angeles County <br>
Arboretum? My notes from finding this box say, per the logbook, it <br>
was planted by "The Sako Clan." I was never sure about this name, <br>
though, because I found the writing in this LB stampbook a little <br>
hard to decipher.<br>
