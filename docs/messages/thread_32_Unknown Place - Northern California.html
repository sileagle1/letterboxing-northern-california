You mention Sako in your post. Can you tell me if your Sako planted <br/>
the original "Succulent Box" letterbox in the Los Angeles County <br/>
Arboretum? My notes from finding this box say, per the logbook, it <br/>
was planted by "The Sako Clan." I was never sure about this name, <br/>
though, because I found the writing in this LB stampbook a little <br/>
hard to decipher.<br/>
