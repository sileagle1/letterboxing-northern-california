three of Double Saj and Old Blue's excellent Seven Deadly Sins of <br/>
Letterboxing series.<br/>
<br/>
Y'all, this is a series that I cannot praise enough.  The carvings are <br/>
delightful, and the location is really lovely.  Nice place for a shady <br/>
hike on a hot summer's day.<br/>
<br/>
(We only went as far as bikes were permitted, so there's still the <br/>
opportunity to be First Finder on sevarl of these fine letterboxes.)<br/>
