Hi all,<br/>
  I visited a friend in Alameda yesterday &amp; took the time to find <br/>
Princess Lea's Sushi House box, the hybrid Geocache/Lb Three Bridges <br/>
box &amp; the Aeroplane Pilot box.  All were fun, but the latter being on <br/>
a separate island made it even more like hunting for secret <br/>
treasure.  Unfortunately, it looks like Princess Lea's Year of the <br/>
Ram box has gone missing.  I didn't have time to find the Year of the <br/>
Monkey box.  Great walks &amp; great views of Oakland &amp; San Francisco, <br/>
but now my feet are killing me.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Sounds as if you are hooked!  Now that letterboxing has you in its <br/>
grasp, you'll find that you are unable to go anywhere without first <br/>
checking for clues in the area.  You will have dreams about <br/>
searching for undiscoverable treasure.  You will soon be overcome <br/>
with the need to carve images on eraser-like material and hide them <br/>
in weird containers.  Welcome to our wonderful world!<br/>

I'll be replanting soon.  Also, I have a Year of the Rooster ready to <br/>

Glad to hear Aeroplane Pilot is still out there - I have gone over 2 <br/>
times to try and get it, but it is always high tide.<br/>

Thanks Mr Grinch.  I've seen your stamp in a number of the boxes.  <br/>
It's fun to be able to already recogize trail names.  &amp; yes, I spent <br/>
most of my lunchtime on Wed figuring out what boxes would be close to <br/>
where I was going.  <br/>
<br/>
I've already got a couple of ideas for box placements.  I really <br/>
thought the Aeroplane Pilot box was well done because it seemed to <br/>
also tie into the owner's interest in RC airplanes.  So, being a <br/>
homebrewing, I'm now trying to figure out how to place boxes near <br/>
brewpubs in the Sacramento area even though they are mostly <br/>
commercial areas.<br/>

Mimulus and I tried to find that hybrid box on the<br/>
19th before the carving gig, but didn't have any luck.<br/>
