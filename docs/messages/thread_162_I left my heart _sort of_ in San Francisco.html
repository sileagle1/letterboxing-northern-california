But with a few hours to spare I was inspired to get some boxing <br/>
done. To get to the point, I managed to find and plant one box. In <br/>
the days before the trip, I debated on where to look for a box. For <br/>
various reasons, once in San Franciso, I settled on one particular <br/>
box. Those paying attention may have managed to have figured out <br/>
just where I started looking. If you haven't, think a while because <br/>
the clues for my plant start from the same location and you don't <br/>
get any more direction.<br/>
<br/>
Once I got the box I was looking for I went back to the start and <br/>
suddenly I was overtaken by the spirit of a fictional character. I <br/>
won't tell you which one, but it is one familar to virtually all. <br/>
You don't need to know which character took over my body, but if you <br/>
do, it may be useful to know once you get to the hiding spot as the <br/>
box has an unusual attribute quite appropriate for the stamp. <br/>
Popular reports aren't quite right, you may think that the <br/>
character's heart was modified on one special night, but actually he <br/>
simply got a new heart. No longer needing the old one, I, or rather <br/>
the character inhabiting my body, decided to leave it in San <br/>
Francisco as local peer pressure demands. I think you'll agree that <br/>
it was best to leave the old one instead of swapping it back and <br/>
leaving the new.<br/>
<br/>
If that made no sense, don't dispair, you can still find the heart. <br/>
Things will probably make more sense once you do, though I can make <br/>
no promises.<br/>
<br/>
Go down from the starting point. At the first fork go northeast. <br/>
Continue below and go NNE at the next fork. Proceed down the trail. <br/>
When the trail comes to a road you should see a pair of triple <br/>
pines. Take the path between the triple pines. Continue on until you <br/>
see a double pine, one leaning, at a bend in the trail. About <br/>
sixteen steps further you will see a tree with many branches and <br/>
trunks to the northeast. On the side of the tree facing the trail, <br/>
at about eye level for a six foot tall person, you can find the <br/>
heart. <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet and particularly careful handling the stamp, for <br/>
reasons that will be apparent once found. This box is an orphan and <br/>
would love an apoptive parent or at least a kindly uncle or aunt. <br/>
Let me know if you are interested.<br/>

It's interesting that we started this series at the same time that there are a number of large fiberglass hearts throughout the city, that have been decorated by various artists. This letterbox series is our version of the same idea.<br/>
