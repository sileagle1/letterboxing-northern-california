Minnesota, so we packed a picnic and drove out to Lodi.  We tasted<br/>
wine and gawked at the sandhill cranes, and even went after a<br/>
letterbox.  We found the Grumpy Grinch's Lodi Libations, which was<br/>
home to a hitch hiker!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the sandhill crane is both imposing and inspiring, and I<br/>
was up late the night before carving a sandhill crane stamp.  <br/>

<br/>
The next day, we handed our guest off to a mutual friend and while<br/>
they were at Fort Funston, we went off on San Francisco letterboxing<br/>
adventures (or misadventures -- I forget which sometimes).  We found<br/>
Paul's gorgeous Magritte: The Therapeutist, and then realized that we<br/>
had only printed out the first page of notes about Cat and Mouse.  We<br/>
then failed to find the first box of Max Was Here, but found the other<br/>
two.  We must have tripped over RedSF and crew, judging by logbook dates.<br/>
<br/>
We hooked up with our pals again, had a great meal in Japantown, and<br/>
then found Paul's lovely Emblem of Eros.  What a great spot for a bit<br/>
of night 'boxing!  I wonder if Paul was being particularly poetic when<br/>
he concealed this box about love in something known for intoxication<br/>
and bitterness?<br/>
<br/>
Not a bad weekend....<br/>

<br/>
We found:<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Dreams, by MoonRabbit.  I think this might be a "perfect"<br/>
series.  The stamps are lovely, the clues seem so mysterious but<br/>
reveal themselves delightfully, and we saw so much wild life, and not<br/>
just the twenty-something guys posing for the video camer in bad<br/>
cowboy outfits and hot pink plastic guns.  Butterflies were all over<br/>
the place, and the birds of prey were astonishing!<br/>
<br/>
You and Me, by Wascally Wabbit.  What a fantastic location!  The<br/>
comments in the logbook were so much fun to read.<br/>
<br/>
Little Shop of Horrors, by Mimulus.  A "killer" stamp in a cool location!<br/>
<br/>
Holy Canoli, Batman, by Mimulus.  I had to look research almost all of<br/>
the clues, but in the drive out I discovered that Robb had a store of<br/>
Batman trivia floating around in his brain.  The location of this<br/>
stamp is totally wild, and unexpected.  <br/>
<br/>
Zin Country, by Princess Lea.  Lea has carved a particularly lovely<br/>
stamp for this box, and to add to the fun, we found a hitch hiker!<br/>
<br/>
The Olive Press, by that sneaky Mimulus.  She's a crafty one!<br/>
<br/>
Embittered Demeter, by Mimulus.  Another super-sneaky combination of<br/>
clue and hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
Persephone, by Mimulus.  This box is in a lovely location.  We learned<br/>
a great deal at this place, and enjoyed the sights and smells and<br/>
sounds.  (The hummingbirds were loudly declaring their territories. <br/>
You've got to admire their feisty-ness!)<br/>
<br/>
Sleep, Drunken Bacchus, by Paul from SF.  Another stunning letterbox<br/>
by Paul.  The clues seemed so opaque, but were a delightful discovery<br/>
when we followed them.<br/>
<br/>
A Word for the Wise, by Mimulus.  Double sided stamp!  Wow!  And<br/>
another hitch hiker...<br/>
<br/>
We thought we had picked a remote spot to examine some of these boxes,<br/>
and then the tour group stopped right in front of us.  Tupperware and<br/>
candy tins flew into our bag with record speed, and we just sat there<br/>
looking as innocent as knew how to...<br/>
<br/>
This was a perfect letterboxing weekend.  Thanks, everyone!!!<br/>

a little hiking and letterboxing.  We found a very diverse group of<br/>
stamps, by letterboxers from all over.<br/>
<br/>
We found:<br/>
<br/>
Wharf Cat by the Drew Family<br/>
Pina Monterey by Talkative Doug and Nanacy Anne <br/>
San Carlos Borromeo Del Rio by Sierra Sally<br/>
...This Old Man Came Rolling Home by Kat<br/>
The Lorax by the Punkinheads<br/>
<br/>
I planted another in my series of Astonishing Creatures, this time the<br/>
stamp is a Sea Anemone.<br/>

Again, thank you to every letterboxer who made suggestions of boxes to<br/>
seek, and to the people who created these lovely images, and shared<br/>
them with us.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">After some questions about the status of Robb's East Bay Trail boxes,<br/>
Robb and I decided to hop on the bikes and check them out.  The Bay<br/>
Trail box is indeed missing, but Pirate's Cove Cannonball is safe and<br/>
sound (or as safe as something in the mouth of a cannon could possibly<br/>
be).  And nobody has found the Bay Bridge Box, yet.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a new letterbox out there.  The Ig Pay Atin Lay East Bay. <br/>
You'll find the particulars at<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=10450<br/>
<br/>
I also posted another series of letterboxes, but unfortunately a nice<br/>
police officer decided to park in front of my hiding spot with his<br/>
lights flashing.  We were short on time (as well as being illegally<br/>
parked) and thought it better to place the box tomorrow morning.  This<br/>
letterbox  is a step in a different direction for me.  It occurred to<br/>
me that there is no particular reason that the only art object that<br/>
could be put in a letterbox had the be a rubber stamp, so I'm going to<br/>
offer a variety of hand made items, each relating to the season at the<br/>
Berkeley Repertory Theatre.  I'm not intending this box to be a<br/>
geo-cache, but just a slight variation on the "find a box, get a<br/>
stamp" formula.  Although the first item (Our Town) is a teensy bit<br/>
bulky, all of these items can be pasted in a logbook.  And, I do have<br/>
a rubberstamp in mind for this series, so letterboxing purists can get<br/>
another stamp, too!<br/>
<br/>
This box is inspired by my summer housemate, who I sucked into<br/>
letterboxing, and who created a letterbox about the theater where she<br/>
works in Buffalo.<br/>

On the other hand, we are delighted to be heading to the Emeryville <br/>

your new boxes then.  Thanks in advance for the fun.<br/>

Did any of you get a nice note from Washington State letterboxers<br/>
SloMo and WoodAug?  They were boxing in the Lake Merritt area, and<br/>
found some of our boxes.  I know it is a little thing, but I am always<br/>
so pleased when I get a message from someone who found one of my<br/>
boxes.  Particularly if they enjoyed them, as these two did.  They<br/>
commented on the high quality of California boxes.  <br/>
