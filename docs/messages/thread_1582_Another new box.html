Certain of you may remember that there once was a letterbox <br/>
called "The Hunt for the Temple of Neptune of Atlantis", which was <br/>
quite possibly the first underwater letterbox. It was based on lore <br/>
that parts of San Francisco were once Tlamco, a city of Atlantis, <br/>
which had several temples, the sites of which have been identified in <br/>
today's city. That letterbox has vanished and returned to Atlantis.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that another letterbox from Atlantis has appeared, this <br/>
time dedicated to the Temple of Saturn, or The Death Temple of <br/>
Atlantis. It's located in the place where the original temple was <br/>
supposed to have stood.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link which describes Tlamco, and the whereabouts of the <br/>
letterbox:<br/>

You misunderstood. The Temple of Neptune was the earlier box <br/>
(underwater). The new box for the Death Temple (Temple of Saturn) is <br/>
also from Atlantis, but in the location where the Temple of Saturn <br/>
once stood.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at the clues -- that explains the temple locations.<br/>
