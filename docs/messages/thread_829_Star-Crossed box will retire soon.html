I'm going to start cycling boxes in & out of circulation, as a way to <br>
make them easier to monitor and manage. Last year, a large number of <br>
my boxes vanished, and it hurt. I was discouraged and stoppedn <br>
planting completely.<br>
<br>
By decreasing the number 'exposed' at any point in time, I'm hoping to <br>
reduce the classic problem that many urban boxes have of being MIA.<br>
<br>
'Star-Crossed' has survived a full year, and I'd like the chance to <br>
hang on to it. It may return at some point in the future. In the <br>
meantime, I'll keep you busy with some new boxes.<br>
