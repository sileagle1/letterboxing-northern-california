                    <div class="plaintext-content">Joined this list a few weeks ago and have been lurking. My problem is <br>
I didn't have much time for research before I left and now I don't <br>
have much commputer time here. We are leaving the SF area and heading <br>
to Yosemite and West Lake Tahoe. I need boxes in those areas, I'm with <br>
my family who will only put up with so much boxes so a good hike is OK <br>
but I don't want to drive far. I know this area is not actualy covered <br>
by this list but I'm short on time.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all who responded to my call for help. I was only able to snag a few boxes. My <br>
family will only go for a limited number of boxes on any given vacation. Some boxes were <br>
just too far flung to fit in with our plans. We will be back!<br>
