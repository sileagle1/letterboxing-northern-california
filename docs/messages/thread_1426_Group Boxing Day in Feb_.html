                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
  I just had an idea.  As I mentioned in the email I just sent, I'm<br/>
planning on taking Feb 5-9 off, &amp; devoting 1 day to Letterboxing during<br/>
that time.  Anyone want to go with me?  Last Jan, I had a great time<br/>
with Princess Lea, Double Saj, Old Blue &amp; Amanda from Seattle getting a<br/>
number of boxes north of the Bay.  Maybe we could do something like that<br/>
again.  Not any official type of gathering, just group boxing.  As of<br/>
right now, I'm open that whole week, plus the weekends at either end,<br/>
but expect to fill a few day in with family visits, etc.  <br/>
