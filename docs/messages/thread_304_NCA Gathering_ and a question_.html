Hello, all:<br/>
<br/>
Darin and I were bummed to miss what would've been our first gathering<br/>
this summer. But I was ready to pop with a shiny-new Lber any day<br/>
(Daniel Henry was born on August, Friday the 13th), and didn't like to<br/>
stray too far from the hospital in Sacramento. We'd all three probably<br/>
be up for it in spring, though - 'specially if it does happen to be in<br/>
our own hunting grounds ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who wrote me about needing to replace the log in the<br/>
Natomas Oaks Microbox. We finally made it over there a couple weekends<br/>
ago, and man, that puppy was crammed full. I'm happy that so many people<br/>
have been able to visit. <br/>
<br/>
Question about personal stamp etiquette: is it okay to scan and post the<br/>
microbox visitor logs on our website? Since there's no room to keep the<br/>
logs in the microbox permanently. That way, folks can still take a look<br/>
at who's visited. If this is taboo, how has this been handled for other<br/>
microboxes?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Jennie<br/>

CONGRATULATIONS!  And the very best news is that the lovely child <br/>
shares my birthday (I too was born on a Friday the 13th).  Can we call <br/>
him Prince Daniel?<br/>

I believe some people wish to keep their personal stamps "secret" and <br/>
only visible within logs where they have visited, so I'd be careful <br/>
with this.  Unfortunately I think that means you'd have to handle it on <br/>
an individual basis.<br/>

tri-folded then rolled a large sheet of paper which we thought was a brilliant way to <br/>
get a log into a microbox. So many of the microboxes logs are too tiny for <br/>
some signature stamps to fit and this solves the problem. We've used this <br/>
technique a couple of times ourselves in our own little boxes.<br/>
