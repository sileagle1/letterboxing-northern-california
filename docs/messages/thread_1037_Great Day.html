                    <div class="plaintext-content">While kids at Gma's and my wife not wanting to go, I headed out and <br>
got aT Wine Goddess-great stamp and cool hiding spot, attempted Big <br>
Four, but couldnt find due to flooding/mudslides.... got "Calistoga" <br>
and ran into a new boxer from Sebastopol-"Tinker" it was her 4th box. <br>
then tried "a toast to the good times" and ran into "the box-a-lots" <br>
and we searched, but couldn't find the box. So we all headed <br>
to "missing bones" and after distracting 2 locals sitting right by the <br>
box got that one. We soon parted and I headed up to and got "Angel <br>
Wine". Didn't quite make it to "Aristacat" as the winery was closing. <br>
Nice day, great drive, ipod on shuffle and loud, 2 exchanges, some <br>
boxes...who could ask for more...<br>
