holidays.  I did finally get over the 200 mark, with a lot of help for the Googled group <br/>
down in San Luis Obispo.  Just before Christmas I found the following boxes which <br/>
are alive and well:<br/>
<br/>
Buzzard's Halloween Letterbox<br/>
Magiz the Crow<br/>
Bella of Brockhall<br/>
Log a Log<br/>
The Other Building<br/>
<br/>
These were all in SLO.<br/>
<br/>
Next, right after the holidays we went to Tahoe, and on the way I picked up In-N-Out <br/>
Burger in Davis and I-80 series #1 in Auburn.  Unfortunately the rest of the series and <br/>
all the other boxes in Tahoe were under the snow.<br/>
<br/>
Did everyone see that there are 2 new boxes planted on the peninsula (Palo Alto and <br/>
Mountain View)?  I'm so glad, because that area needs some coverage.<br/>
