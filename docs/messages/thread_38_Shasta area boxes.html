You guys should have hit our Wild Goose just along the freeway south of Willows. The box can be a 24 hr. free drive by,a day time pay to enter short hike or a very cool 6 mile drive. Was the Queen City Shasta under water? When Gwen retrieved it she had to wade through 6 inches of water and the safe was completely filled with water with the micro box just hanging in there. Unfortunately our camera was out of film as it would have made a great photo of me standing warm and dry under an umbrella watching her wade barefoot through icy water.<br/>

  Ryan and I were able to stop at two letterboxes on our drive from <br/>
  Seattle to San Francisco the other day...we got the Dammed Shasta <br/>
  letterbox and Queen City Shasta letterbox. Both were in great <br/>
  condition and waiting patiently for more visitors.<br/>
