                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a great letterboxing afternoon in Contra Costa.  We didn't <br/>
manage to find Ducking Responsibilities by FilmFanTam.  But we now <br/>
notice that it is no longer listed on LBNA nor Atlas Quest.<br/>
<br/>
We were first finders on the Ringo Duck and Cee Cee's Letterbox, <br/>
bringing home a bag of bird seed in addition to a cute stamp and fun <br/>
outing.<br/>
<br/>
We found Linda's Contra Costa Series #1 box in Mt. Diablo State <br/>
Park.  Unfortunately it was exposed.  The logbooks (2) were there <br/>
but the stamp was missing.  <br/>
<br/>
We placed a micro-box somewhere within this northern area of the <br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
Then we went to the south entrance and followed OBJuan's wonderfully <br/>
written clues.  That was the start of our fun.  His narrative <br/>
launched our imaginations as we moved back in time to search for his <br/>
first box.  We were first finders on both boxes.  The hiding places <br/>
were clever and the carvings are superb.  We love what he is adding <br/>
to our letterboxing community.  Thanks to all of you who made today <br/>
so great.<br/>
