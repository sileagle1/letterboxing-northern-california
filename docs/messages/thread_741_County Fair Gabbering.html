It is not important to have a theme really, but the whole Gold Rush <br>
thing was so excellent, and Left my Heart in SF for GGG the year <br>
before as well, so, why not?  I propose any boxes become some sort <br>
of traveling event troupe ala Boch's circus. but it is not <br>
necessary.   I will carve and plant one, hopefully Wascally and <br>
MoonRabbit will consider adding one apiece and if anyone from father <br>
away wants to entrust me in finding a hiding place in my <br>
neighborhood you can mail me a box before hand or just hide it that <br>
morning.  OF course, not too many boxes since we want to have time <br>
to talk...<br>
<br>
At this point I will commit to providing various sausages, buns, <br>
condiments, grilled peppers and onions.  Ice, iced tea and coffee. <br>
<br>
I think Carole could be persuaded to bring some of her great baked <br>
goods.  And as long as everyone else doesn't decide to bring chips <br>
and salsa we will be in great shape.  (you know ....the potluck <br>
where everyone brings bread, chips and nothing to drink!)<br>

Yes, you can count on me doing some baking.  I will also make an<br>
Italian Pasta Salad.  It will be an ample amount for all.<br>

I think the traveling stamps are a great idea rather than planting a<br>
bunch. I know the heat will keep Da Kats from hunting. We plan on<br>
bringing along a traveler.<br>

Looking forward to July 24!<br>

<br>
This will be great. I've spoken with Wahoo and SF<br>
Scott, and we three are pretty sure we'll be there. We<br>
just have to round up Charlene (and hopefully get her<br>
a trail name) and we'll be set. This time around I<br>
definitely want to contribute in the stamp area. Has<br>
anyone volunteered to do an event stamp? I would be<br>
very willing to carve one. <br>
<br>
Tomorrow morning, Wahoo and I depart on our annual<br>
roadtrip adventure. We're heading up to British<br>
Columbia. Hopefully we'll be able to hit a few LBs<br>
along the way. We'll be back in two weeks.<br>
<br>
Till then, everyone stay safe and healthy and happy<br>
LBing!<br>

Since this is practically in our backyard, you can almost certainly<br>
count clan Nebiru in. I have to check with Darin, but I'm almost certain<br>
we'll all attend. Our first event! And, sadly enough, our first<br>
exchanges (yes, we haven't a one, so sad). <br>
<br>
Plotting a design for a new stamp here in Petaluma; hope to have it out<br>
there within a couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
Daniel is trying to escape through the cat flap, so I'll have to think<br>
more on what foodstuffs to bring and get back later...<br>
