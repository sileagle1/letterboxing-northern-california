Sad but tru the logbook form Pomo was pretty wet so I have removed <br>
for maitainence and she will realight....probably somewhere else <br>
since I noticed poison oak around that tree and would hate to give <br>
someone a case of the itchies.  Stay tuned.<br>
<br>
Mim...<br>
<br>
oh yes, it was very warm at sugarloaf today..I made the loop today <br>
and it was 80 degrees a the top, if my little pulltab thermometer is <br>
to be trusted.  I did see great wildflowers....buttercups, shooting <br>
stats, hounds tooth, lupins, camus, lomatium, larkspur.  And for the <br>
first time in the wild I saw our native clematis....just loaded with <br>
blossoms ready to burst any day now.  And some really pretty flower <br>
in the Mint/Labiatae family with red blossoms and pretty foliage I <br>
can't find in  my wildflower book.  <br>
<br>
So, if you do go to SLSP remember almost 20 boxes and if you spend 5 <br>
miutes at each thats two hours just for stamping in so plan on lots <br>
of time there.  <br>
