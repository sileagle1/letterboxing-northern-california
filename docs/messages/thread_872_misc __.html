I think I'm leaving in a week on a road trip through Northern Cal, Oregon, WA & would love box recommendations. I'm not sure of my exact route, unmissable boxes will probably have an influence. Can I show up in Gresham for the Pokers Wild Rally? We'll see. If cars are allowed.<br>

Are there rattlesnakes at Hog Heaven? And is it dog friendly? I've heard about the stickers & heat, those aren't dog friendly, but are they allowed?<br>

Dogs are not prohibited, but it would be extremely hot for them. If you take your dog make sure you water it frequently and wet it's ears and feet. We have never seen any rattlesnakes, but I always presume that snakes are about.<br>
There are tons of boxes along the way, but if you would like a D&G box with only one visitor in three years then you should look up Dumbledore's Western Adventure. I think the code key throws folks off, but you probably already know the key or atleast where to find it. Have a great trip!<br>

I don't think you actually need a car or any form of transportation<br>
for the Pokers Wild Rally except your feet. =)<br>

I'd be pretty surprised if there weren't any!<br>
<br>

<br>
Dunno about that. Perhaps someone else who's been there recently can<br>
say for sure. =)<br>

If you get to the OR coast, in Florence there's a very interesting <br>
box-Darlingtonia Californica by Pungent Bob then the Hobbit Trilogy by Heron A. Foot up <br>
the coast a ways. Wonderful stamps and a very neat hike! In Portland, the Who <br>
Let the Dogs Out series by Paisley Orca a great hike through a cool Forrest.<br>
Can I show up in Gresham for the Pokers Wild Rally? We'll see. If cars are <br>

<br>
We will be very envious if you get to go to that one!<br>
<br>

<br>
I would imagine there are snakes as the terrain and climate is perfect for <br>
them  but we never saw any. There's really NO ONE up there so dogs are certainly <br>
allowed but there's so many sticker bushes and such I'd think poor Fido might <br>
hurt his feeties. If you keep him close though, and don't allow him to just <br>
run around, he might be OK. Don't miss this Piggy series though. It's a hoot!<br>
