                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks ladies, for your support of this list!  I too think that there<br>
is still a place for it in the world of letterboxing.  As moderator, I<br>
pledge to revive this neglected medium as sort of an early New Year's<br>
resolution.<br>
<br>
Along those lines, here are some ideas I think would be best<br>
implemented herein, rather than on the AQ California board.  Several<br>
ideas have come to me from observation of the LB Mid-Atlantic group<br>
(eastern PA, DE).  I've gotten to visit their territory a couple of<br>
times in the last 2 years and have been very impressed with what I saw.<br>
<br>
They have large parks where all the boxes have the same theme.  For<br>
example, Tyler State Park has all musicians (well mostly, there are<br>
some other random boxes there too).  They are planted by all different<br>
people and they are scattered all over this large park (think Tilden<br>
Park for size comparison).  You can spend DAYS looking for all the<br>
boxes there.  There's another one that has all movies.  <br>
<br>
So one idea I had was to take Tilden Park and do something similar. <br>
The theme I came up with was How Berkeley Are You?  I made a short<br>
list of some things that would fall into this category:<br>
<br>
Hippies<br>
Cal Bears<br>
Free Speech Movement<br>
Chex Panisse<br>
First Bay architecture (Maybeck, Julia Morgan)<br>
Telegraph Ave<br>
Berkeley Marina<br>
People's Park<br>
Grizzly Peak<br>
Strawberry Creek<br>
Berkeley Rep (!!)<br>
(please make more suggestions)<br>
<br>
Of course, I am also interested in hearing about other theme ideas or<br>
locations.<br>
<br>
Now, one challenge I see with using Tilden is that I have a suspicion<br>
that the rangers there don't like letterboxes.  Mine were yanked by<br>
them long ago.  So, we would have to either ask permission beforehand<br>
or never use the name of Tilden Park in the clues, or make them WOM. <br>
I think that by coordinating this effort through the mailing list, we<br>
could keep some semblance of secrecy.<br>
<br>
The other thing that came up during the recent Albany luncheon was the<br>
interest in having a carving demo gathering. It would be ideal to<br>
schedule thing during the upcoming rainy season.  We had something<br>
similar to this about 4 years ago, hosted at Blackbird's classroom<br>
which was a great spot with lots of room and work tables.  Does anyone<br>
have a comparable space that we could use?  I am envisioning not only<br>
carving lessons, but how to make logbooks, how to camo tape a box, how<br>
to use AQ, etc.  Are people interested?<br>

viability of the California lists.<br>
<br>
I do not post much here, or on SoCal list for that matter, but do see <br>
the value of both lists.<br>
<br>
One thing that I do when we receive found notes from new boxers is to <br>
answer back with a post including links to both this list, the SoCal <br>
list and the Newboxers list.<br>
<br>
As the Moderator of the SoCal list ( kind of like the last one of <br>
Custers troops as Ryan doesn't receive emails and Ca. Bear is <br>
sporadically active)I do not set up any communication functions like <br>
Topics and such. It seems like the list stays pretty quiet until a <br>
meet and greet or a gathering of some sort.<br>
Since there are other methods of communication I do not see that the <br>
SoCal list is there to generate discussion ,but rather a way to post <br>
current information. I'm not proposing this for this list, only <br>
advising what I've been doing in SoCal. <br>
While this can turn some folks off, those that get the posts will <br>
only get those every once in a while, so they won't be bugged with <br>
non-informational posts.<br>
<br>
There are those letterboxers that do not attend the AQ community.<br>

The person wasn't taking about this group or the southern California<br>
group. He was referring to the group at<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-ca/?v=1&t=search&ch=web&pub=groups&sec=group&slk=1<br>
<br>
Spend a couple of minutes there, and you'll wish it were dead too. ;o)<br>

Well, one thing that was good that came from the discussion on AQ was that I<br>
learned of this list.  I'm happy to be signed up now to have another means<br>
of communication with local boxers.<br>
<br>
I love the idea of a demo/training day.  We're newbies, and my carving<br>
skills could *ahem* use a bit of help.<br>

a Bind it All for logbooks.  Even provide supplies to make them.  Just<br>

plant boxes.  Then...we can go boxing!!! whoppeee<br>

<br>
So nice to hear from folks. For some reason I haven't made my way through<br>
the AQ boards, maybe because there are so many. I miss this group, it<br>
always seemed easy to stay in touch with my closest boxing pals. I would<br>
love to see it revived. Thanks for your commitment, Lea.<br>
<br>
I would love to see Lisa's studio & do a carving day, I'll just have to<br>
wait and see what the date is and what the weather is doing. I'm so happy<br>
to just stay put right now and watch the white stuff come down.<br>
<br>
I hope you all have happy holidays,<br>

 We are not newbies but our carving skills could use a bit of help! <br>
Plus we need little encouragement to spend a few hours with fellow<br>
letterboxers, schedules permitting.<br>

Consider that your arms have been twisted for the next few years.<br>
<br>
Little encouragement indeed.<br>

Merry Christmas to all of our Northern Friends.<br>
