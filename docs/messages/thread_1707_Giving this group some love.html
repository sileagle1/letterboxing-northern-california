                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks ladies, for your support of this list!  I too think that there<br/>
is still a place for it in the world of letterboxing.  As moderator, I<br/>
pledge to revive this neglected medium as sort of an early New Year's<br/>
resolution.<br/>
<br/>
Along those lines, here are some ideas I think would be best<br/>
implemented herein, rather than on the AQ California board.  Several<br/>
ideas have come to me from observation of the LB Mid-Atlantic group<br/>
(eastern PA, DE).  I've gotten to visit their territory a couple of<br/>
times in the last 2 years and have been very impressed with what I saw.<br/>
<br/>
They have large parks where all the boxes have the same theme.  For<br/>
example, Tyler State Park has all musicians (well mostly, there are<br/>
some other random boxes there too).  They are planted by all different<br/>
people and they are scattered all over this large park (think Tilden<br/>
Park for size comparison).  You can spend DAYS looking for all the<br/>
boxes there.  There's another one that has all movies.  <br/>
<br/>
So one idea I had was to take Tilden Park and do something similar. <br/>
The theme I came up with was How Berkeley Are You?  I made a short<br/>
list of some things that would fall into this category:<br/>
<br/>
Hippies<br/>
Cal Bears<br/>
Free Speech Movement<br/>
Chex Panisse<br/>
First Bay architecture (Maybeck, Julia Morgan)<br/>
Telegraph Ave<br/>
Berkeley Marina<br/>
People's Park<br/>
Grizzly Peak<br/>
Strawberry Creek<br/>
Berkeley Rep (!!)<br/>
(please make more suggestions)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I am also interested in hearing about other theme ideas or<br/>
locations.<br/>
<br/>
Now, one challenge I see with using Tilden is that I have a suspicion<br/>
that the rangers there don't like letterboxes.  Mine were yanked by<br/>
them long ago.  So, we would have to either ask permission beforehand<br/>
or never use the name of Tilden Park in the clues, or make them WOM. <br/>
I think that by coordinating this effort through the mailing list, we<br/>
could keep some semblance of secrecy.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that came up during the recent Albany luncheon was the<br/>
interest in having a carving demo gathering. It would be ideal to<br/>
schedule thing during the upcoming rainy season.  We had something<br/>
similar to this about 4 years ago, hosted at Blackbird's classroom<br/>
which was a great spot with lots of room and work tables.  Does anyone<br/>
have a comparable space that we could use?  I am envisioning not only<br/>
carving lessons, but how to make logbooks, how to camo tape a box, how<br/>
to use AQ, etc.  Are people interested?<br/>

viability of the California lists.<br/>
<br/>
I do not post much here, or on SoCal list for that matter, but do see <br/>
the value of both lists.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I do when we receive found notes from new boxers is to <br/>
answer back with a post including links to both this list, the SoCal <br/>
list and the Newboxers list.<br/>
<br/>
As the Moderator of the SoCal list ( kind of like the last one of <br/>
Custers troops as Ryan doesn't receive emails and Ca. Bear is <br/>
sporadically active)I do not set up any communication functions like <br/>
Topics and such. It seems like the list stays pretty quiet until a <br/>
meet and greet or a gathering of some sort.<br/>
Since there are other methods of communication I do not see that the <br/>
SoCal list is there to generate discussion ,but rather a way to post <br/>
current information. I'm not proposing this for this list, only <br/>
advising what I've been doing in SoCal. <br/>
While this can turn some folks off, those that get the posts will <br/>
only get those every once in a while, so they won't be bugged with <br/>
non-informational posts.<br/>

There are those letterboxers that do not attend the AQ community.<br/>

Well, one thing that was good that came from the discussion on AQ was that I<br/>
learned of this list.  I'm happy to be signed up now to have another means<br/>
of communication with local boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of a demo/training day.  We're newbies, and my carving<br/>
skills could *ahem* use a bit of help.<br/>

a Bind it All for logbooks.  Even provide supplies to make them.  Just<br/>
say when.  Maybe the ideas floating around will spur some people to<br/>
plant boxes.  Then...we can go boxing!!! whoppeee<br/>

<br/>
So nice to hear from folks. For some reason I haven't made my way through<br/>
the AQ boards, maybe because there are so many. I miss this group, it<br/>
always seemed easy to stay in touch with my closest boxing pals. I would<br/>
love to see it revived. Thanks for your commitment, Lea.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to see Lisa's studio &amp; do a carving day, I'll just have to<br/>
wait and see what the date is and what the weather is doing. I'm so happy<br/>
to just stay put right now and watch the white stuff come down.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all have happy holidays,<br/>

Consider that your arms have been twisted for the next few years.<br/>

Little encouragement indeed.<br/>
