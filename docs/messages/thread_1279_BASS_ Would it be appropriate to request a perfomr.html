Spring has sprung and so has Boch's Circus from winter hibernation.<br/>
<br/>
I went down to the train station yesterday. Amidst the excitement of<br/>
the busy platform I waved "bon show" to the departing circus train.<br/>
The ears of the Dancing Dog flapped in the wind as it hung out the<br/>
window. Boch's Traveling Circus and Wild Menagerie is back on the<br/>
road for a new season of regaling an appreciative audience with some<br/>
of the finest impressions of physical entertainment from around the<br/>
country. ["And more blather from his Ringmaster<br/>
Verboseness." "Hushh."] As I was saying ...<br/>
<br/>
Upcoming performances include:<br/>
<br/>
-Ice Cream Sundae Letterboxing Event - Carlisle, Massachusetts -<br/>
April 23, 2006<br/>
<br/>
---A sampling half dozen of some of our finest and fun acts.<br/>
<br/>
-Wilmington Film Fest - Wilmington, North Carolina - May 13, 2006<br/>
<br/>
---At the Film Fest we plan a rambunkxious Circus Clown reunion when<br/>
a new act joins us. Introduced by his great grand neice, Bert Leo<br/>
shall make a triumphal return to the "great show" and meet Boch's<br/>
other circus clownsters. (We have more clowns than I even realized.)<br/>
Yes his real great grand niece will attend and has graciously agreed<br/>
to exchange and sign autographs.<br/>
<br/>
Many other new acts joined us in our last travels and are available<br/>
for future performances:<br/>
<br/>

by Springchick (Shh. I don't think he wants her to know.)<br/>
<br/>
These acts and more are available for bookings at your local<br/>
gathers.<br/>
<br/>
Onward with the shows.<br/>

Most perspicaciously yours,<br/>

them sent to the BASS.  There are a bunch of events slated for that weekend though - <br/>
hope someone else hasn't scooped them up.  Mim, are you in contact with them or should <br/>
we have Eclipse, as event coordinator, contact them?<br/>
