letterbox.  Nestled inside of it was......a live earwig!<br>
<br>
Those of you who have found this box may understand why I found this<br>
amusing (once I had dumped Mister Crawly on the ground, that is.  I<br>
hate earwigs.  Once you've had your loofah rain out earwigs while<br>
you're showering with it, it is impossible to feel much sympathy for<br>
these critters.)<br>
<br>
If that's not ooky enough for you, you can read a hilarious faux memo<br>
regarding the dangers of earwigs at the Folklorist:<br>

Cheers!<br>
