Ah, yes, our old stomping ground. We lived in Yuba County (The Boonies) on and off for 20 years. Home of Beale Air Force Base and the Bok Kai Temple (only one in the Western Hemisphere). When Jiggs lived in Sutter county, he had one at the Temple which only lasted a couple of weeks. With all the transients and nae'r do wells in the town of Marysville, finding a planting site is very difficult. <br/>
<br/>
Planting a box there is high on our list but it would be out of town on Hwy 20 towards Grass Valley. There's SO much history in that county that there's a TON of carving ideas. . . OK, you've inspired us. We'll move it to the top of our list. Of course, if anyone wants to beat us to it, you can be the First, First Planter.<br/>
