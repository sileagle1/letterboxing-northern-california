Saturday, we were headed to Santa Rosa for a family visit and tried to<br/>
get as many boxes along the way as possible.<br/>
<br/>
We started in Glen Ellen and was able to get:<br/>
<br/>
Brine Country by Mimulus<br/>
Rock Repose by Mimulus<br/>
Embittered Demeter by Mimulus<br/>
A word to the Wise by Mimulus (Great two sided stamp)<br/>
Sleep, Drunken Bacchus by Paul in SF.  Our first hinged stamp, and a<br/>
great one, at that!<br/>
Persephone by Mimulus<br/>
and 2 hitchhikers (oh, drats!)  I don't like hitchhikers but my<br/>
husband does.  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday morning we picked up the the American Graffiti Series (3 boxes)<br/>
by Wascally Wabbit and<br/>
Say Cheese by ltrbxnfools before heading down to the carving demo.  We<br/>
were hoping to get the Museum of Modern Art series by PrincessLea<br/>
before the demo but traffic prohibited us from doing so.  After the<br/>
demo, we got the images of the museum stamps #2 and #3.  PrincessLea<br/>
was most kind and graciously walked with us and did a little "box<br/>
maintenance".  <br/>
<br/>
All of the stamps were excellent.  What a group of talented people!! <br/>
This was even more evident when artTrekker was nominated (by me) to do<br/>
our carving demo Event Stamp and she came up with a beautiful and<br/>
appropriate stamp within minutes.  We had a wonderful time visiting<br/>
with those that attended.  Can't wait for the Lb Gathering planned for<br/>
April!!<br/>
<br/>
Grand total for the week-end:<br/>
12 Finds<br/>
2 Hitchhikers<br/>
13 Exchanges<br/>
1 Event Stamp.<br/>
