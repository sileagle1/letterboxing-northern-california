                    <div class="plaintext-content">My thanks to the Gillespie Tribe for warning me that the site of my MK74<br/>
mystery box was finally under construction.  Da Kool Kats had told me<br/>
earlier in the year that construction was scheduled, but I hadn't gotten<br/>
around to finding out exactly when.  Luckily, the construction fence did<br/>
not contain the actual box hiding place.  Unluckily though, I had to<br/>
wade through chest high star thistle to retrieve it.  But, my 1st<br/>
letterbox is now safely stored away &amp; may be replanted once the<br/>
construction's completed.<br/>
<br/>
This does bring my total active box count down to 2 out of 10 though, &amp;<br/>
one of those has never been found.  I guess I better finally get around<br/>
to planting those children's book stamps I mentioned a while ago.<br/>
