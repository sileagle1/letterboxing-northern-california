                    <div class="plaintext-content">Please don't forget to bring your portable chairs to the BASS.  With <br/>
45+ people planning to attend, you don't want to rely on park <br/>
benches for seats.  If you've got an extra camp table or card table <br/>
and room to tote it, bring it along.  Please, too, bring serving <br/>
utensils for your potluck contribution.<br/>
<br/>
Questions for those who have seen the barbecue area:  how large is <br/>
the grill?  Will it suffice to cook vegetables then veggie <br/>
dogs/veggie burgers, and finally hot dogs and hamburgers for all of <br/>
us?  If not, does anyone have a small portable grill they'd be <br/>
willing to bring?  We have plenty of charcoal, just don't want to <br/>
take HOURS cooking before everyone gets something hot.<br/>
<br/>
We will be bringing a new set of barbecue utensils for vegetables <br/>
then veggie items.  We'll have a separate set for meat.  We've also <br/>
got separate service pans after it's cooked.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that all the details are sorted, we are truly looking forward to <br/>
meeting, greeting, and visiting with many of our fellow letterboxers.<br/>
