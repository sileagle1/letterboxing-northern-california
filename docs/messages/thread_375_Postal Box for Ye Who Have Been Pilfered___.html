So I was holding off on signing up for this box, even though my John <br/>
Henry Mystery Box has now gone missing twice and one of my Claremont <br/>
boxes went missing. I figured, gone missing doesn't necessary mean <br/>
someone %$#@$ed with the box.<br/>
<br/>
But today I was notified that one of my Huntington boxes, though <br/>
still hidden in place, is suddenly missing it's stamp and log book. <br/>
Why would you take everything out of the box but then hide it back <br/>
in place?! I should have asked if any lame toys were left behind, <br/>
just in case it was a geocaching incident.<br/>
<br/>
So...can someone contact me for my address for the Postal Box for <br/>
the cursed ones?<br/>
<br/>
