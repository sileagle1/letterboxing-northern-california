logbooks lately. Hopefully that will change since I  dropped Ben off<br/>
at school today...and perhaps I can find some time to letterbox again!<br/>
<br/>
But first I need to catch up on all the delayed maintainence I have n<br/>
all my boxes up this way.  I see I need to make a sojourn to the city<br/>
to get Paul's new boxes..what fun!  <br/>
Hpe to bump into some of you when I do!    hope everyone is well and<br/>
looking foward to some fun fall boxing.<br/>
<br/>
best to all, <br/>
