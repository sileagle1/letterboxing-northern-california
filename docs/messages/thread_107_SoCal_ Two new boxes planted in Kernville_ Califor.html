                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just posted two new letterboxes on Letterboxing.org, which were <br/>
planted during Don &amp; Gwen's wonderful Kernville Gathering. It was <br/>
nice to see Ryan and Amanda again, though I was disappointed that <br/>
DoubleSaj and Old Blue were not able to make it because of illness in <br/>
the family.  My wife is sick-as-a-dog at the moment, so maybe Old <br/>
Blue got the same affliction (it's the Captain Trips!!!!).  Amanda, <br/>
Sierra Sally and I found that letterbox I was searching for around <br/>
the Kernville Historical Museum--it wasn't located there at all, <br/>
duhhh!  And I still haven't gotten to your Easter Bunny Letterbox in <br/>
Fullerton, what a lazy-poop I am!<br/>
