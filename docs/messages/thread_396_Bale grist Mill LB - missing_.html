Yesterday my letterboxing pals and I went up to the Bale Grist Mill,<br/>
north of St. Helena. We took the tour of the mill and talked a long while witht he ranger,<br/>
who was an extremely nice and informative lady. After the tour wrapped up, my friend had <br/>
a few questions for her. She then asked what brought us to the area and my friend<br/>
gingerly brought up the subject of letterboxing. She hadn't heard of letterboxing before, <br/>
but when she saw our stamp journal, she became intrigued. Then she paused and said, <br/>
"Oh wait a minute!". A few months earlier, an employee saw some people climbing over a <br/>
fence and looking through the brush. It was prime rattlesnake season and the ranger on<br/>
duty at that time went to investigate....<br/>
<br/>
So, the ranger who was there yesterday offered to help us look for<br/>
the box...She said she liked the idea of letterboxing, but was concerned about people<br/>
getting hurt during rattlesnake season. We couldn't find the box, and the ranger even<br/>
looked all around inside the building to see if the other ranger had confiscated the box, <br/>
but it wasn't anywhere to be found. In the end, she said that I could stamp my book with <br/>
the CA state park stamp for Bale Grist Mill (which is pretty neat). The ranger suggested <br/>
that to avoid getting boxes confiscated it is probably best to discuss with the ranger <br/>
(maybe the placer of the bale grist box did?) about placing on State Park property. Our <br/>
ranger mentioned that she thought letterboxing was a neat hobby and that she saw no <br/>
harm in placing a box near a stump or anywhere that wasn't delicate, but that because <br/>
there was a lot of brush in the immediate area, anything that required going behind the <br/>
fence was probably not the best idea.<br/>
<br/>
Well, nevertheless, we got to see a lovely area that we hadn't seen before and we got to <br/>
meet an awesome park ranger who is really a credit to her profession.<br/>

<br/>
The two-box letterbox series you might be thinking of<br/>
is the "Westwood Hills Regional Park" series (off of<br/>
Hwy 29 near Napa), also by Lisa (who placed the Bale<br/>
Grist Mill box ("Napa - Not Wine"). unfortunately, we<br/>
didn't have the time to try that box or the Aristacat<br/>
box...<br/>
<br/>
good luck for your game and for letterboxing!<br/>
