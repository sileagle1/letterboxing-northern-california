Yesterday my letterboxing pals and I went up to the Bale Grist Mill,<br>
north of St. Helena. We took the tour of the mill and talked a long while witht he ranger,<br>
who was an extremely nice and informative lady. After the tour wrapped up, my friend had <br>
a few questions for her. She then asked what brought us to the area and my friend<br>
gingerly brought up the subject of letterboxing. She hadn't heard of letterboxing before, <br>
but when she saw our stamp journal, she became intrigued. Then she paused and said, <br>
"Oh wait a minute!". A few months earlier, an employee saw some people climbing over a <br>
fence and looking through the brush. It was prime rattlesnake season and the ranger on<br>
duty at that time went to investigate....<br>
<br>
So, the ranger who was there yesterday offered to help us look for<br>
the box...She said she liked the idea of letterboxing, but was concerned about people<br>
getting hurt during rattlesnake season. We couldn't find the box, and the ranger even<br>
looked all around inside the building to see if the other ranger had confiscated the box, <br>
but it wasn't anywhere to be found. In the end, she said that I could stamp my book with <br>
the CA state park stamp for Bale Grist Mill (which is pretty neat). The ranger suggested <br>
that to avoid getting boxes confiscated it is probably best to discuss with the ranger <br>
(maybe the placer of the bale grist box did?) about placing on State Park property. Our <br>
ranger mentioned that she thought letterboxing was a neat hobby and that she saw no <br>
harm in placing a box near a stump or anywhere that wasn't delicate, but that because <br>
there was a lot of brush in the immediate area, anything that required going behind the <br>
fence was probably not the best idea.<br>
<br>
Well, nevertheless, we got to see a lovely area that we hadn't seen before and we got to <br>
meet an awesome park ranger who is really a credit to her profession.<br>

for boxes (ie, not near some endangered species nesting spots).  I am <br>
also all for not encountering any rattlesnakes!<br>
<br>
According to my notes there are 2 boxes at Bale Grist Mill - which one <br>
did you search for?   We are headed up to that neck of the woods on the <br>
30th to watch the Cal Golden Bears in their Bowl game (Go Bears!) and I <br>
was going to see if I could get my family to stop there on the way - <br>
even if only to get the stamp for our Sesquicentennial book.  Does <br>
anyone know if Aristacat is still alive and well?  Or any other boxes <br>
along Highway 29?<br>

<br>
The two-box letterbox series you might be thinking of<br>
is the "Westwood Hills Regional Park" series (off of<br>
Hwy 29 near Napa), also by Lisa (who placed the Bale<br>
Grist Mill box ("Napa - Not Wine"). unfortunately, we<br>
didn't have the time to try that box or the Aristacat<br>
box...<br>
<br>
good luck for your game and for letterboxing!<br>
