We were in SLO in March and Driftwood by the Sea,Crone Tree, Harry Potter, SLO Halloween, and Palme D'Or were all in place.We haven't received any reports on our Gull in the Sky, and Shady Coyote so we assume they are still in place. If you do Ryan's Walking Tour(highly reccomended) figure on several hours. If you liked the Sign Bite in Kernville then you will like the Walking Tour.<br/>

I've heard reports that one of the Black Hills boxes is missing.  <br/>
(Amanda's)  But neither of us have gone out to confirm that.<br/>

If you came through a month or two ago, you could have been the <br/>
first finder for some of these boxes.  =)  Hid them over two years <br/>
ago and until I dragged Amanda out so I could check up on them, <br/>
nobody had ever found Loop 2.  (As it is, I think only Amanda has <br/>
found Loop 1 when I dragged her out so I could check up on those <br/>
boxes!)<br/>
<br/>
So far as I know, all the other boxes in the list are alive and well.<br/>
