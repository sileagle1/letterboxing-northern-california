the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Kauai.  What a place!  What<br>
a lovely carving!  ArtTrekker never fails to amaze, with both content<br>
and context!<br>
<br>
I'll admit that we totally failed to fins it on our first try -- we<br>
were a little over heated and under fed.  But once we had eaten and<br>
snorkelled, our brains started working again, and we found it with no<br>
trouble at all!<br>
<br>
I even got a letterbox planted today.  But I've got fruity blender<br>
drinks to consume, so I'll post clues another time!<br>
