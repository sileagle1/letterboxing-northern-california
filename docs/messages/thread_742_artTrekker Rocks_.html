stamps from this talented carver to my collection. I was <br>
in CA this last week for biz and made a point of tracking <br>
down the three boxes in Placerville and my last stop before <br>
the Sacramento airport was hot off the carving board, the <br>
wonderful new Milk Farm box. When I first saw artTrekker's<br>
sig stamp in a book last fall I was chomping at the bit to get <br>
an opportunity to find one of her boxes.  Keep 'em coming!<br>
<br>
Some of the other boxes I visited while in the area were: <br>
Scoopie's Bee Hive, North Fork Dry Diggins, I-80 #1 (replaced,) <br>
Where's the Fire, Furry O, Nymph of the Sea, Olive Tree, Slinky Dog, <br>
Rainbow Brite #4 and Yolo Oak. The only box I attempted and <br>
failed to find was Howler in Redding. If I was in the correct spot, <br>
the hiding place is now submerged by the lovely Sacramento <br>
River... oops! Thanks all for the diversions from actual paying<br>
work. I really like all my new stamp images.<br>
<br>
I checked on my Ide Adobe and Woodson Bridge boxes. Both <br>
are doing fine. Just the other day, I also heard that Buckhorn is <br>
waiting patiently for a visitor or two. A couple of new offerings <br>
are hiding along my path. Watch for the clues, one in Red Bluff <br>
and the other in Chico. Now Chico has this HUGE gorgeous park <br>
with miles and miles of hiking trails of all descriptions and only <br>
two measly little letterboxes.  I think it's just screaming for a little <br>
letterbox love... any takers???<br>

Thanks so much for the support. Congrats on first finder of Milk Farm! Did you keep your feet clean? I think it's a mulberry tree, in full fruit.<br>
<br>
My mom and I got Folsom Powerhouse a week or so ago, and it was such an ordeal! It was hot and rainy, so we were drenched in sweat & had a little trouble making sense of the directions (no one else did, from the log entries--we were just the spazzes who forgot our compass) and there were some mosquitoes...The stamp is very nice, and we were so happy to find the box at last! That acorn hasn't sprouted a very big tree yet, but in the coming months, I will see what I can do to rectify that.<br>
<br>
I am so bummed. I lost my personal stamp. Yes, artTrekker the stamp is MIA at Duncan's Landing. Mim's excellent series Sea Creatures is SO worth visiting, and if you go to Duncan's Landing (there is a sort of barrier trying to keep people away from the restrooms--I went through the grass at the right side, and this seems like a logical place for my poor little stamp to be lost--it vaporized between the car and the box, a very short distance), could you please do a little search for me? It is in a little felt pocket, kind of a grass green one, with the pink stamp hiding inside. I looked all I could, but my mom had to be back in Healdsburg to teach a piano lesson and we were already late. Playing hooky boxing. (Little Shop of Horrors rocks!) I had to carve a new stamp for Healdsburg Amadeus (my mom) after she lost hers at Sideways, and the new one is such an improvement, I have to see this as an opportunity. But I'm kind of attached to my pencil-toting trekker. I will think up some very nice reward if someone finds it and gets it back to me!!<br>

THREE? I know artTrekker is a great artist, but you missed ours? I <br>
thought we were buddies? Granted, Chile Bar isn't in downtown <br>
Placerville, but it isn't that far. I realize the clue text is pretty <br>
long, but it is almost a "reach out the window" driveby, Waaa, waaaa, <br>
waaa, waaa.<br>

Now doesn't that name just cry out for a stamp. Joe Cool?<br>
<br>
Okay we forgive you. Hmm that box hasn't been there that long, maybe <br>
some bridge support enthusiasts or slate collectors have come across <br>
the box?<br>
