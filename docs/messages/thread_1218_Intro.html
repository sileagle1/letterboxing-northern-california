<br>
Just a little note of introduction, update, and Thanks!<br>
<br>
I just learned about Letterboxing last week. I use to love doing <br>
beginner orienteering and this sounded very fun. I happened to see a <br>
few boxed only a couple of miles from my house in San Jose that I <br>
thought would be good to start with.<br>
<br>
My daughter came home from work and I grabbed her and dashed out the <br>
door. <br>
<br>
I am not very artistic or creative. So, I thought it would be okay to <br>
start with a store bought stamp and then take some time ( and many <br>
redos I am sure) to make my own.We got some stamps and journals.<br>
<br>
First we headed to "Maybe Next Year..." and after some searching we <br>
succeeded. Thank goodness it was empty of people, because I must of <br>
looked very silly on my hands and knees. I did a little happy dance! I <br>
felt like a little kid or someone who had just hit a jackpot.<br>
<br>
Then we headed over to "Get out of Jail Free" I am pretty sure we were <br>
at the right bench but we couldn't find it. Oh well.<br>
<br>
For Father's day we went to Old Sacramento, my parents and two of my <br>
three children. So, I looked up the location and wrote down several <br>
clues for several boxes. We were able to find three and the location <br>
for three more but no boxes. We all got into it and had lots of laughs<br>
<br>
I am so impressed with the creativity of the stamps and clues. <br>
Thank you to all the planters. My family is brainstorming now to see <br>
if we can plant a few.<br>
<br>
Just tonight we found two more and thanks to all the wonderful people <br>
who planted in and around San Jose, we have lots more to look forward <br>
to finding.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Sassy F.<br>

Alameda Co. (we're in Oakland) and look forward to venturing further out to<br>
find more - and to plant some, too.<br>
