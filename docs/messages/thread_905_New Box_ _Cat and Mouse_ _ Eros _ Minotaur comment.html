I truly thought RedinSF was going to surprise everyone... Anna <br/>
again! Anna, are you on a scooter now, too? How do you maneuver so <br/>
fast? Princess Lea is still parking her car...<br/>
<br/>
The location is one of the spots that those 2 informed guys I met <br/>
while working on 'Minotaur' suggested that I use for planting a box. <br/>
It's sort of a secret oasis smack in the middle of the city. If you <br/>
can get to 'Cat and Mouse' between 3 - 5 PM, the late afternoon <br/>
light is really magical.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have mosquito trouble ... maybe it was the time of day. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm extending 'Emblem of Eros' until sometime in Novemeber, in <br/>
honor of Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue, who are in Italy celebrating their <br/>
anniversary. They need more time to get to 'Eros', and since they're <br/>
part of the clues, I'm happy to extend.<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to the epic Maze... did you know that 'minotaur' is a word <br/>
that combines Minos, the king of Crete, and taurus, or bull? It <br/>
tells you that it was King Minos' bull. It lived in a labryinth, <br/>
which may refer to his grand palace at Knossos. <br/>
<br/>
Current thinking believes that this was the product of overly active <br/>
imaginations. Crete hosted festival games that featured acrobatics <br/>
involving bulls. Athens would diplomatically send youths to <br/>
participate in these dangerous games. When they died in bull <br/>
accidents, and didn't return, fertile Athenian minds got facts <br/>
scambled, and the legend of the minotaur was formed. <br/>
<br/>
I went to Knossos on Crete several years ago, and the scariest thing <br/>
about it was the busloads of tourists. The secret is to visit at <br/>
noon, when the buses take lunch. There are fabulous frescoes there, <br/>
including one of a youth somersaulting on the back of a bull. <br/>
<br/>
I see the story of the minotaur as a myth about facing and <br/>
conquering your fears. Quite heavy on the testosterone...<br/>
