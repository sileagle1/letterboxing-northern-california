                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Friday February 18th Sleepy Cat and I found the following boxes <br/>
(which are therefore alive and well!):<br/>
<br/>
SFO<br/>
Peter, Peter<br/>
Saxon's Nemesis<br/>
Go Spartans!<br/>
<br/>
We also replanted the Egypt Game boxes which were pulled while <br/>
renovations were underway at that facility.  The only box we couldn't <br/>
find was Procyon Lotor out in Portola Valley.  It was a GREAT location <br/>
that looks like it has the potential for lots more boxes (hint hint to <br/>
Peninsula LBers)<br/>
