My assessment:  Fun, crazy, hectic, but good!  I came home with 39 new stamps in my book--not bad for a day's haul.  I should have had 3 more, but apparently Spongeboboh stamped someone else's book instead of mine...still not sure how that happened.<br/>

As I was getting ready to leave for the event on Friday, I got a pain in my<br/>
chest, and tingling down my arm. I went to the Emergency Room at Davies<br/>
Medical Center, where they diagnosed a mild heart attack. I was immediately<br/>
treated with a heart catherization, and stayed overnight at the hospital. I<br/>
was released the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
I'm feeling OK, and resting at home.<br/>
<br/>
Hope the event was fun.<br/>

We missed you Saturday, Paul, and wondered what you were up to.  Thank <br/>
goodness you had a legitimate excuse, none of that "dog ate my <br/>
logbook" nonsense....<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the medical emergency, we're glad to hear you're back home <br/>
again and starting your recuperation.<br/>
