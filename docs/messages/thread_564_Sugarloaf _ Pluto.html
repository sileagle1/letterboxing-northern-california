&gt;So, you are saying it was back where the trail splits off to the actual <br/>
&gt;Brushy Peak?  That means it actually leaves the trail, at least <br/>
&gt;according to my map.  That's why I didn't go up there!  There was <br/>
&gt;another place where the trail divided, and that's where I thought I <br/>
&gt;missed Pluto (that time I went up, instead of taking the side route).  <br/>
&gt;Sorry, but I AIN'T going back for Pluto!<br/>

Yes, we did the exact same thing.  The map that we printed from the <br/>
Sugarloaf site only showed<br/>
one split and we veered off and went around instead of over and then we <br/>
came to another split  and<br/>
decided we should go over instead of around.  Pluto was at the top of <br/>
the first one!! <br/>
