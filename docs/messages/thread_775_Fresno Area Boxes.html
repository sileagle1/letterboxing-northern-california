anniversary, we were happy to find all 9 of the boxes we tried for. <br>
Thanks to Sierra Sally, Da Kool Kats and Grumpy Grinch for the great <br>
boxes--to wit:<br>
<br>
Alien Smorgasboard<br>
Able Was I Ere I Saw Elba<br>
Say Cheese (really great place to have lunch!)<br>
Fresno Water Tower (so interesting!)<br>
Tiger Tale (first finders)<br>
Fresno County Cultural Trail boxes #1, 3, 5 and 8<br>
    (box #1 had a slimy, soggy log that was beyond fixing, I'm sorry to <br>
say but the stamp was usable.) Too bad there are so many reported <br>
missing on this series. The idea is a good one and the stamps are great!<br>
<br>
Thanks to all!!<br>
Oh, there's a ferocious HH planted in one of the aforementioned boxes!<br>
