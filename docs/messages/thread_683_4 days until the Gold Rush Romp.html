I will not be able to make the GRR regrettably.  I just need to spend some more time with my Mom in Louisiana while we work through some stuff since my Dad passed away suddenly.  <br/>
<br/>
I emailed with Don regarding his box - and he asked that I keep it and plant it in memory of my Dad when I return.  Very kind.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to leave you all in a lurch - but I just can't swing it right now.  We will plant our boxes for everyone's entertainment later this season....<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time and a successful gathering!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Honour of the Boxalots<br/>

Honour,<br/>
<br/>
Please accept our condolences on the recent, sudden loss of your <br/>
Father.  We recently planted a memorial box in Sam Houston Jones <br/>
State Park north of Lake Charles, LA.  It was our second memorial <br/>
box and reflects a lot of love and happy memories.  I hope you are <br/>
able to achieve the same with your Dad's memorial box after your <br/>
return.  <br/>

Susie Fuselier (of the Grumpy Grinch duo)<br/>
