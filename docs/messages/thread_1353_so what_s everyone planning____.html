Thanks for the kind words, Kel.  You are too sweet.  Actually, Old <br/>
Landmark Box is still available.  It was recarved and placed in a <br/>
more permanent place at the beginning of the year.  <br/>
<br/>
Our Able Was I Ere I Saw Elba box is missing now.  We will probably <br/>
re-do it, as well, since I like the story of the "Battle of <br/>
Waterloo" being so close to home.  It should be an improved image <br/>
since it was our first letterbox and carving.  We have learned a <br/>
little more about carving since then.<br/>
<br/>
Before reading this post, I was just discussing with Gary Kat how  <br/>
our boxes are usually off topic or theme for the events.  How does <br/>
that saying go?  "Marching to the beat of a different drum."  That's <br/>
us!!<br/>
