                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a WONDERFUL event we had in Old Scaramento today! About 50 Newbie <br/>
to Avid (to obsessive) letterboxers gathered in perfect weather to find <br/>
the 27 boxes hidden for this event. Because this area is about 3 by 5 <br/>
blocks, we were able to do it all on foot and most of us increased our <br/>
F-counts by a dozen or two! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Sierra Sally for organizing this event to the gnat's eyelash <br/>
with great prizes and homemade goodies--including ice cream--for <br/>
dessert. Da Kool Kats donated a ton of prizes for lucky winners such <br/>
as: ArtTrekker who won prize baskets for her expertly carved stamps and <br/>
for the most planted for the event (7). Amanda from Seattle who won a <br/>
prize for all-time most boxes (somewhere around 1200) and she and <br/>
Princess Lea won for most boxes gathered today (27).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who stamped our books and who otherwise made this <br/>
event one to remember. Congratulations to you all!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">ABSOLUTELY!  Great to meet everyone (sorry about the bad clue on the <br/>
Golden Spike).  I collapsed when I got home, but had a blast wearing <br/>
myself out.  &amp; after a quick nap &amp; getting my daugther to bed, I went <br/>
back out around 9 to try to find more.  Got that ornery Rattlesnake <br/>
Dick, the Gatorlovers' Covered Wagon &amp; Lee &amp; Nancy's railroad car.  <br/>
Also saw BoneDoc, Lil Bear &amp; Messanger skulking around too.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the 27 boxes, there was also the event stamp, 3 <br/>
travelling stamps, &amp; at least 4 personal travellers.  Thanks to Sally <br/>
for the organization &amp; ice cream, Carole for the cookies &amp; chocolate &amp; <br/>
everyone for making it such a good time.<br/>

fun. BC is correct. Lil Bear, The Messenger (who was apparently message shy<br/>
that day but who usually has plenty of messages for us on a daily basis!)<br/>
and I all went back out to search for more boxes after people left. We found<br/>
5 more, gave up on a few, and ate dinner there. We finally headed out around<br/>
10pm. <br/>
<br/>
It was like a wedding. It is constant activity and there never seems to be<br/>
enough time to talk to everyone..then it's over before you know it and we<br/>
sit around and look at pictures and try to remember the details.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hiding the boxes!<br/>

to!  Spent as much time in that museum as I did at the gathering itself.<br/>

Also glad I could help some people cheat on Bone Doc's<br/>
questions--those were hard! =)<br/>

Muchas gracias to Sierra Sally and friends who planned the event, and<br/>
everyone else who attended!<br/>

Happy trails!<br/>

Ok, let me clarify, when's the next one that isn't more than 3 hours <br/>
away?  It was more of a rhetorical question, implying it was so much <br/>
fun, let's do it again soon.<br/>

Sacramento to Los Angeles shouldn't be more than an hour or two flight<br/>
away.  Certainly not more than three!<br/>
