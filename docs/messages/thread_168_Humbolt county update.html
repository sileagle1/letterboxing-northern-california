We were right behind you in Ferndale on the 4th.  Found the Cemetery <br/>
box staight away but no luck on For the Glory.  Found two differnd two <br/>
different mossy logs at switchback and searched around various large <br/>
trees bought found only stinging nettles.  Never a cairn.  Too bad we <br/>
could not have also looked for your boxes too!  I have an idea to <br/>
plant a box at the Benbow Inn in Garberville, so maybe when I back <br/>
again to plant that box I can look for the new ones.  <br/>

Did you get a chance to see the 4th of July Parade?  It was <br/>
classic small town Americana.  We really enjoyed it .  The Oasis <br/>
box in Eureka is in a very lovely place.  Well worth the visit.    We <br/>
look forward to additional boxes to search for up there.   <br/>

Yes!  We got there just as it started and really enjoyed it.  My five <br/>
year old gave it two thumbs up...although he thought they could have <br/>
thrown more candy.  I must admit I was hoping to see some past entries <br/>
from the kinetic race in the parade but the museum had to suffice.  <br/>
HOpe to go back this winter and try your LB's.   <br/>
