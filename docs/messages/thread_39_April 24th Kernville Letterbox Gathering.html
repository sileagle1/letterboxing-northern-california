Per your SoCal Letterboxing post:  if you're sponsoring a letterbox <br>
gathering in Kernville on April 24, 2004, count me in!  I contributed <br>
a few dollars for site rental, brought hamburgers, and planted a <br>
local letterbox for the San Luis Obispo Letterbox gathering.  Just <br>
let me know if you're looking for this sort of volunteer effort for <br>
your gathering; I'd be glad to help. <br>
<br>
Per another post, you mentioned your plans for a Tiburcio Vasquez <br>
letterbox series, and I've been thinking about it.  You might <br>
remember I wrote to you about this bandito's history in my own little <br>
town of Pasadena.  Per the book "The San Gabriels" by John W. <br>
Robinson, on April 15, 1874, after holding up a ranch in the town of <br>
San Gabriel, Vasquez and his gang, after spotting a Sheriff's posse <br>
in pursuit, raced towards their San Gabriel Mountain hideout.  After <br>
pausing to hold up three men near "the Indiana Colony" (Pasadena), <br>
they galloped up the Arroyo Seco canyon closely followed by the <br>
posse.  <br>
<br>
The Pasadena Bridge, which spans the Arroyo Seco, is where you found <br>
my Suicide Bridge Letterbox (Halloween Series).  Since the Pasadena <br>
Bridge borders the site of the original Indiana Colony, from here you <br>
could probably spot the location where Tiburcio held up the three <br>
men, if you knew the direction to look<br>
<br>
Followed by the posse, the banditos travelled up the Arroyo Seco into <br>
the mountains eluding their pursuors by a bare margin. At one point <br>
in the chase, Vasquez lost a pistol.  This pistol, with the initials <br>
TV carved on the barrel, was found by 16-year old Phil Begue of La <br>
Crescenta in 1883.  Years later his son sold it to San Gabriel <br>
mountain historian Will Thall.  <br>
<br>
With your permission, since you originally came up with the idea of a <br>
Tiburcio Vasquez letterbox series, I'd like to plant a letterbox on <br>
the Arroyo Seco trail that commemorates this event.<br>

It is either Don & Gwen or Gwen & Don. Just remember Gwen is Don's trail name and Don is Gwen's trail name. We haven't figured out very much of the agenda for the Kernville gathering as yet. It will have a team event for finding the Event stamp via paddle raft, but other events are still up in the air. Depending on weather a Saturday night BBQ may be at our home .  Vasquez was already  memorialized in the Robbers Roost letterbox by Paperdance long before we did our Coyote Hole Stage Robbery. If you go on line you will find a lot of info on this rascal. William Secrest included him in several of his books on the wild west in California. I'm thinking about doing one in the Caliente area on Dick Fellows whose story is almost too funny to be true. Then there is Black Bart , Tom Bell and Chris Evans so many outlaws that did a lot of time. I think Vasquez was finally captured at Greek Georges ranch by LA Sheriff William Rowland. At the time there was $8,000 on Vasquez's head plus added money from Wells Fargo and lawmen from any juridiction were able to collect and keep reward money on the bad guys they captured. Many of the out laws were captured by several of the same lawmen and the Wells Fargo Chief of Security James Hume played a prominent role in keeping records on those that robbed the stages. I think that California Desperados letterboxes would be a fun project, so please do add to Vasquez and go for some others. Maybe some of the folks around the other parts of California will join in.<br>

Yeah, it's been known to happen the best of us.  But at least the e-<br>

The biggest problem is that the Forest Service along with various agencies such as CHP make access very difficult. The FS has destroyed the tubs at Miracle several times as they claim the germ counts are very high.(Maybe some one will carve a great germ stamp for a Miracle Hot Sorings LB?)

Per your SoCal Letterboxing post:  if you're sponsoring a letterbox<br>
gathering in Kernville on April 24, 2004, count me in! Mapquest tells<br>
me that you are 400 miles away and I would walk it to be there. By the<br>
time this gathering happens I will have planted my first box (the<br>
carving is comming allong slowly). Hope that the boys school work will<br>
let us be there.<br>
