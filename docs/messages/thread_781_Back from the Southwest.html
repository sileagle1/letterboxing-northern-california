business-type trip.  And, what's even better, I was able to finally<br/>
box out-of-state!  AZroadie has done some really great stamps in some<br/>
really great places in Tucson and other spots in AZ, and, Funhog<br/>
introduced us to a great place that is currently my new favorite spot<br/>
(at least for this week)!  We dropped off a couple of HH's, helping Da<br/>
Kool Kats move along a couple. Yeah, to box again where the weather is<br/>
less than 110 degrees!  And no rattlers.  And no scorpions.  And yes,<br/>
we did hear the sounds of a rattler near one of the boxes.  Luckily,<br/>
we also had a walking stick to fend off any hungry creature.<br/>
