                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
It's been a while since most of you heard from me.  I've had a busy<br/>
and stressful couple of months that haven't quite let up yet... and I<br/>
have a tendency to flit between hobbies, all of which means I've been<br/>
slacking and lurking, but reading faithfully.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could join you this weekend for the No Foolin' gathering - it<br/>
looks like it's going to be a blast.  I hope you all have a fantastic<br/>
time; I'll be out of town on family business.<br/>
<br/>
However, I did want to kind of test the water and see if any of you<br/>
would be interested in having your sig stamp - or really, any stamp -<br/>
replicated in a solid silver one-of-a-kind piece of jewelry.  I was<br/>
hoping to be at this weekend's gathering to share this idea with you<br/>
in person, but since I can't, please read on!<br/>
<br/>
One of my many hobbies is silversmithing/jewelry making, and one of my<br/>
most recent pieces is a copy of my own signature stamp, turned into a<br/>
pendant.  You can see it here:<br/>
<br/>
http://flickr.com/photos/tuliphead/436134080/<br/>
<br/>
My jewelry is fine silver (99.9% silver - not sterling) and can be<br/>
left plain, oxidized (when you see black/brown in the recesses of<br/>
silver, that's oxidization - it highlights details), or even inlaid<br/>
with the color(s) of your choice as I have done in my example piece. <br/>
I can turn your stamp into a pendant, a ring, earrings, a broach, a<br/>
keyring, or something else entirely - it's up to you.<br/>
<br/>
There are, of course, size limitations, mostly due to the cost of<br/>
silver, but also because of the fact that really honkin' huge silver<br/>
jewelry is kind of unwieldy.  If your sig stamp is huge, though, and<br/>
it's what you really want, we have options.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at a range of about $35-$75 per piece, depending on what<br/>
you ask for - again, this is just a general estimate.  Smaller pieces<br/>
with less finishing are on the low end of that scale, of course; rings<br/>
and larger pieces or pieces with gemstones (I can do that too) or<br/>
other fancier finishes will cost more.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this isn't limited to your sig stamp - if you have a special<br/>
image in mind or would like to custom carve one, that's great.  If you<br/>
want to recarve your sigstamp to make it slightly smaller, that's fine<br/>
too.  You should note that the medium in which I work will shrink your<br/>
image about 8-10%, but there will be no loss of detail (unless we're<br/>
talking very very small stamps).  Your stamp will be returned to you<br/>
undamaged for your reuse, as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested or have questions about my jewelry, please feel<br/>
free to contact me at this email address.  I'm happy to answer any<br/>
questions you might have.  I'm just testing the water with this idea<br/>
at this point - you're the first letterboxers to whom I've suggested<br/>
this - so I'm curious to see if anyone would be interested or if I<br/>
should shop this idea around to a larger group.  Please let me know<br/>
what you think!<br/>
<br/>
Happy 'boxing,<br/>

WOW I am so impressed with your creativity. Not only are your jewelry<br/>
designs amazing, the photos of them are incredible. Not worthy of my Cow<br/>
Calf stamp. But I'll keep it in mind, hopefully I'll find some design<br/>
that I can have you make for me. <br/>
