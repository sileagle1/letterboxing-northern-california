                    <div class="plaintext-content">Amanda, Lea, Old Blue, DoubleSaj &amp; I met up this morning for Lea's tour <br/>
of the Point Reyes boxes.  We ended up getting 9 out of the 8 boxes we <br/>
went for.  Yes, I wrote that right.  We found all the boxes of a <br/>
mystery series somewhere in Marin county, #1-3 of the Alien is Lost by <br/>
the Alien Explorers, &amp; #2, 3 &amp; 4 of Blackbird's Tomales Point series.  <br/>
#4 had been apparetnly reported missing by some people, but we were <br/>
able to find it &amp; it was doing fine.  The other boxes were all doing <br/>
well also.  So, we went out only planning on 8 boxes, but ended up <br/>
getting 9.  I'll be counting Tomales Point #4 as a RF1, refind count.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for putting it together Lea.  It was the 1st time I'd had a <br/>
chance to out hunting as a group that wasn't at a gather, &amp; had a great <br/>
time except for the soggy feet.  I'll be hopefully posting some of the <br/>
pictures i took.<br/>

spring, and I replaced several of them.  I'm happy to hear that they are alive <br/>
and well, except for #1.<br/>

I've been out of the loop with an emergency surgery and my hiking is still <br/>
limited to the less strenuous sort.  I'm hoping to get back into the swing of <br/>
things in the next few months.<br/>

ps -- There are some new Oakland boxes that are easy drive-bys, if you <br/>
get itchy.  (Isn't it sweet of me to offer this as a public service?)<br/>
