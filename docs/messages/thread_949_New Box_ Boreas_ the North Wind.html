was my final project.<br/>
<br/>
Boreas is in an extremely beautiful spot, well worth visiting. The <br/>
link is here:<br/>

<br/>
There are 4 more gods, including Skiron, who pours hot ashes out of a <br/>
jars, and Libbs, who holds the prow of a ship, but I think I can <br/>
safely move on to the many other boxes on my To-Do list.<br/>
<br/>
This was a good idea, though, picking a theme of several related <br/>
complex images as carving practice. When I look at the 4 of them, I <br/>
can see definite improvements in my carving -- especially with drapery <br/>
folds. I'd recommend a project like this to anyone wanting to get <br/>
better at carving.<br/>
