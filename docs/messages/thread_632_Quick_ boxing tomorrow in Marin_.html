<br/>
My son is going to Marin tomorrow with friends (an adult and another 6 year<br/>
old) to see a performance, in San Rafael, at 1pm.<br/>
<br/>
They'll have two possible times to letterbox: they can arrive in Marin<br/>
around 11:45am but have to make it to San Rafael by 12:45pm (a VERY quick<br/>
box between the Richmond-San-Rafael Bridge and San Rafael - I know, that's<br/>
probably not doable), and between 2-4pm.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to figure out how far the Marin letterboxes are from each other and<br/>
how long each might take to find, but I'm getting dizzy trying to figure it<br/>
out. Could anyone give us a tip: is there something they can actually do in<br/>
these time slots? More than one box in an area would be more appealing....<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for planting - and any tips!<br/>

I'd try for "China Camp" out San Pedro ,very close to Marin Civic <br/>
center(if thats where the show is??) also if you have a HH to place <br/>
the brand spankin' new "Jungle Inn" HH hostel is right by Civic <br/>
center too. They might have time to do "Deer Park" or "Sorich <br/>
pokemon"...but all of the boxes I mentioned are on dirt trails so <br/>
watch out for MUD!<br/>
