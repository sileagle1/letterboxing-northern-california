day.<br/>
<br/>
Re-placed A-Bears A Speed Limit box. Found Little Lizard (a very lonely box). And #1 and <br/>
#2 of Lea's Schoolhouse Rock series. #1 was a little soggy from the winter too but #2 was <br/>
nice and dry.<br/>
<br/>
I also discovered that one of my own boxes (Itchy &amp; Scratchy #2) seems to have been <br/>
washed away in the last winter storms. I thought it was well away from the stream but I <br/>
guess I could have placed that one better. Will try to replant that one later this year.<br/>
<br/>
This is some of the best letterboxing weather!! Love it!!<br/>
