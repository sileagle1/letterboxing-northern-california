It would be supprising if we observe many along the trail, but you should assume they are there and are checking you out. Sometimes being a tough old Buzzard works as they probably are looking for something more tender. <br/>

On another subject <br/>
<br/>
When Gwen &amp; I started seeing "dvn2r ckr" in various letterboxes we had a bet as to what her  name was. I thought it was "Dive into Rocker" and she thought it was "Divan to Rocker" . Upon writing this mysterious letterboxer, we found out we were both wrong, but still use our pet names whenever we see dvn2r ckr.<br/>
