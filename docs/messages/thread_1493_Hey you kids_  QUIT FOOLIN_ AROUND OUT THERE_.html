<br/>
For last minute clues, there are a couple of options:<br/>
<br/>
1) There is a chain link fence at the back of the Chaparral picnic<br/>
area.  I am bringing poster board, markers, and binder rings.  Folks<br/>
can write out their clues and post them on the back fence.<br/>
<br/>
2) If the clue is too long to write out by hand, there will be some<br/>
foam core posterboard on the back fence, some thumbtacks.  Folks can<br/>
post it there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) Lastly, if folks have already printed clues, (I know DemXXMen are<br/>
planning this for example), we will have a table near the sign-in with<br/>
stacks of clues.  <br/>
<br/>
Some folks want to do only WOM clues, which is certainly their<br/>
perogative.  I would just politely point out that a relative neophyte<br/>
(ME!) has gone to the trouble of organizing this thing and I would<br/>
prefer we be as inclusive as possible.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.  <br/>

We're just counting on the fact that muggles are unobservant<br/>
creatures, hoping that they will not 1) see the eggs, 2) examine the<br/>
eggs, 3) read the enclosed clues, 4)seek out letterbox with said<br/>
clues.  And if they do do all that, that they are pleasant examples of<br/>
the species, that they will simply enjoy and return, and that<br/>
everything will be right as rain for next weekend...  <br/>

hopefully it'll work *shrug*  --dorkanon (again)<br/>

<br/>
First the egg red herring and now the misinformation campaign (this is<br/>
what I expected when I planned this for April Fool's Day--I just though<br/>
I'd be pulling the jokes and not falling for someone else's).<br/>
<br/>
The gathering is absolutely positively on SUNDAY April 1st.  I am<br/>
sleeping in on Saturday, so anyone who shows up on Saturday is out of<br/>
luck.  Besides, I think some lucky 10 year old is having his birthday<br/>
party at that picnic area on Saturday.  So while you might score some<br/>
cake and maybe a piece of candy from the pinata, I suspect if you ask<br/>
them if they are letterboxers they won't respond with, "which direction<br/>
is north?", but instead suggest that you go pound sand.  Or perhaps<br/>
wack you with the pinata stick thinking you are one of those guys Chris<br/>
Hansen catches being bad Dobby.<br/>
<br/>
No Foolin'  IT'S ON SUNDAY!!  The AQ Announcement is true.  I am<br/>
pulling lots of other tricks, but I wouldn't mess with the date or<br/>
meeting time.  Besides, there's a whole mess of food showing up at<br/>
11:30am on SUNDAY.  While the squirrels would be just tickled pink by<br/>
their sudden bounty, the Ranger would not appreciate the sudden<br/>
epidemic of obesity of the resident bushy tailed vermin.  <br/>
<br/>
So, the fake dog poo letterboxes will be planted that morning.  Be sure<br/>
to bring your pooper scooper and gloves in case you mistake the real<br/>
thing for a letterbox.  I'm going to the neighbor's yard that morning<br/>
to collect some "live rounds" to plant amongst the fakes ones.  Keep it<br/>
interesting.  (Maybe we should have let DemXXMen run with the egg<br/>
idea....)<br/>
<br/>
Remember, this isn't espionage, it's letterboxing!  Let's go have some<br/>
fun.  Enjoy that spring has FINALLY sprung, that Uncle Sam will soon<br/>
extract his pound of flesh and then it will be another year before we<br/>
have to endure taxes again (no offense Da Kool Kats--you undoubtedly<br/>
make a painful process less so, but it's still tax season!).  And yes,<br/>
the park will be chock full o' non-letterboxers.  Hey, it will make<br/>
things a challenge.  Think of them like crazy rabid squirrels.  Could<br/>
be annoying, could be your best form of entertainment.  It's all a<br/>
matter of perspective.<br/>
<br/>
So, joke away DemXXMen, just make sure you don't forget to show up on<br/>
the actual day!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Renee,  who has recently found her sense of humor that had been<br/>
misplaced.  The three glasses of Wattle Creek Muscat might have<br/>
something to do with that......  <br/>
