Planted by Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue<br/>
Mendocino County<br/>
Closest town: Fort Bragg<br/>
Difficulty: Easy and short on a dirt campground area. Kids need to <br/>
beware ofthe edge of the riverfront cliff area. Dogs on leash<br/>
Time: 10 minutes if you're good<br/>
<br/>
Big River Campground is but a babbling brook, 18 miles east of Fort <br/>
Bragg on Highway 20. Pull in to this shady campground in the redwoods <br/>
and park in the small, dirt lot. In summertime, it's probably very <br/>
crowded so be descreet!<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
Walk past the big sign board you'll see from the parking area and <br/>
take a right at the "T" to the picnic area #6. You'll see a picnic <br/>
table and a fire pit. Take a bearing from this fire pit at 83 <br/>
degrees, almost due east. Pace 80 single steps to an enormous 6' <br/>
tall, burnt out tree stump. There's a fence about  way there. You <br/>
decide whether to go over it or around it. There's not much of a <br/>
trail but you can weave around bushes (and probably poison oak in the <br/>
summer) but watch your step when you get close to the edge near the <br/>
river. Squeeze through between tree trunks and stumps of the 5 other <br/>
trees in this little area, making your way to that huge, hollow <br/>
stump. The Gift of the Redwoods is in the hollow of the stump, about <br/>
eye-level, behind a cleverly placed, vertical piece of wood which <br/>
needs to be replaced exactly the way you found it for proper drainage.<br/>
