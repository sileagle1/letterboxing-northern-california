I use a program called FinePrint (http://www.fineprint.com/) that allows me <br>
to print 2 pages on 1 sheet of paper. We also reuse office paper by <br>
printing on the other side. I frequently copy text into Word as well and <br>
then reformat it to make sure that doesn't take more pages than necessary.<br>
<br>
Also, the "Print this Page" link on the top of any clue page on <br>
letterboxing.org displays the text without the background graphic and <br>
links, so the pages are shorter and will print with less ink than if you <br>
simply print from the clue page itself.<br>

Yes, I've cut and pasted the clues into word and I'm still in excess <br>
of 300 pages!  I haven't yet played with the fonts, though.  I also <br>
live by 'fine print' so we can print 2-4 pages of text on 1 sheet of <br>
paper but my laser printer just dropped dead and I'm forced to rely <br>
on my 6 year old back up desk-jet that prints about 4 pages a <br>
minute. :(  This is why kinkos may truly get this printing job--just <br>
so we can get out the door with 'hardcopy' clues in hand!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the helpful hints!  I've loaded many of the clues into my <br>
laptop but can't visualize myself walking a trail with an open <br>
laptop in front of my face.  ;) That's usually the dead giveaway of <br>
a geocacher (GPSr glued to hand, eyes fixated on the satellite <br>
trackers on the screen)--and people often ask us how we know they're <br>
geocachers when we meet them along the trails!!! ;) The clues are <br>
just on the laptop for those critical times when we're in a spot <br>
where we know a letterbox exists but we don't have access to the net <br>
to get the clues--saves on the cell phone minutes!  ;)<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

I've been thinking of getting a PDA onto which I can download all of the <br>
clues from letterboxing.org on a regular basis. That way I'll always have <br>
the clues handy. Does anyone do this or have any recommendations? I had a <br>
Palm Pilot (one of the originals) and then a Palm VII many years ago that I <br>
used faithfully for a long time, but I don't know the best mix of software <br>
and hardware to accomplish this now -- anyone have any suggestions? <br>
(Someone recently told me how they were doing this, but I don't remember <br>
who or where it was in all my letterboxing journeys!)<br>
<br>
And, yes, I have used my laptop while in the car to review clues and look <br>
at maps in Microsoft Streets & Trips software.... Almost as bad as trolling <br>
from my car for an open wireless connection to check email....<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"><br>
On Atlas Quest, if you print the clues with a modern-day browser, it<br>
actually prints in a smaller than normal font, and it will<br>
automatically strip the pictures (if the user uploaded one), ads, and<br>
the menu bar at the top that will take you back to the main AQ website.<br>
<br>
Pre-CSS browsers it'll still print everything, but for 95% of the<br>
people surfing the web that print clues listed on AQ, it does its best<br>
to help reduce paper use, and wasted ink.  (And thus, does not need a<br>
seperate "Print Version" of the page like you see on LbNA.)<br>
<br>
Well, there is one exception to the smaller text--if someone has as<br>
part of their preferences a "large text" format for the website, it'll<br>
print clues in a larger text as well.  (Approximately the same size as<br>
LbNA would print at.)<br>
<br>
It does a few other alterations as well.  It removes links from print<br>
outs (after all, you can't link on a piece of paper!), turns the text<br>
black (in case the user set the web version to some other color),<br>
turns the background color to white (again, in case the user sets the<br>
web version to some other color), and minor things like that that most<br>
people wouldn't even notice unless it's pointed out to them.  =)<br>
<br>
But if you want to get more than one clue on a single page, use even<br>
smaller text, or remove some of the "fluff" some people add to their<br>
clues, you'll still get better results copying and pasting into<br>
WordPad or Word and doing it yourself.  There's only so much that can<br>
be automated!<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of adding a print size option so users can specify<br>
exactly what size print jobs should print at (to a minimum of 1/72nd<br>
of an inch--if that would even print legably!)<br>
<br>
But in any case, this only applies to clues that are actually hosted<br>
on AQ.  Otherwise, it's whatever the default value is set at for that<br>
particular website.<br>
<br>
On another note....  it does this sort of thing for all the pages on<br>
Atlas Quest--slight changes from what you'd see on your monitor to<br>
what actually gets printed out.  If you wanted to print out a<br>
tutorial, it WILL leave in the pictures (since they're an intregal<br>
part of the tutorials), but it'll strip the navigation bars, AQ title<br>
bar, and other minor changes like that.  CSS is SOOO cool!  =)  If you<br>
want to know how something on Atlas Quest will look when it's printed<br>
out, definitely do a "Print Preview" before actually printing.<br>

Ok--here's the way NOT to print if you're on a tight budget.  <br>
<br>
I transferred all clues from boxes in which we're interested to a <br>
word file and purged them of extraneous bits of info, but included <br>
occasional mapquest map insets and such--since we're not familiar <br>
with many of the areas we may be visiting.  Dumped them all into <br>
files entitled CA letterboxes or LA letterboxes, etc.  Then, printed <br>
them via word to my fine print program.  Then printed them from <br>
there to the FedExKinkos print to a store software program I just <br>
downloaded from them.  I splurged and had the clue sheets bound with <br>
a comb binding so I wouldn't have to go through the tedious process <br>
of punching holes and filing into a binder before we leave for our <br>
trip.  The comb binding should allow you to remove and replace clue <br>
sheets as you go along so you don't have to carry the whole book <br>
with you on a hike.<br>
<br>
Now, I printed a file for all clues to boxes in Way North <br>
Northern/Western CA and Coastal to I-5 Oregon corridor--(the ones we <br>
haven't yet found spanning from the Pacific Coast to about I-5 from <br>
Chico & Marin County up).  That print job with 2 pages of text <br>
printed on one sheet of paper each was about $9 after tax.  Without <br>
the binding, it was probably $5.50 or so.<br>
<br>
Then, I sent another file with clues from all of San Diego, Los <br>
Angeles and a couple of East Bay area boxes (i.e. like 6 boxes or <br>
so) we'll attempt and that print job cost around $15.<br>
<br>
I can only imagine how expensive it would have been had I printed 1 <br>
page per sheet or clues to letterboxes in the ENTIRE state of CA!!!  <br>
Oh, going double sided was MORE expensive for some reason.<br>
<br>
So, that's my spur of the moment, last minute solution to printing <br>
up clues to a saturated boxing locale we haven't visited in ages.  <br>
Yes, this hobby has certainly grown exponentially in the past couple <br>
of years!!!  I remember the days when all the clues to N. CA boxes <br>
fit in a 1 inch binder with plenty of room to spare!<br>
<br>
Yes, I wish my PDA was still working.  It would be really awesome to <br>
be able to avant go letterbox clues to entire regions of the US on <br>
the spur of the moment.  I've been trying to do that with MS <br>
Internet Explorer's Favorites 'make available offline' function with <br>
links 1-2 pages beyond the first linked page but it's not working <br>
for some reason.  Argh!  That would be ideal if I could get it to <br>
work!!!  Then, if that was working, being able to link that to a PDA <br>
would eliminate the requirement to print all the pages every time <br>
you head out on a trek.  Then, your only problem would be to <br>
remember to resynch every so often and then carry extra PDA <br>
batteries on the trail with you.  ;)<br>
<br>
We'll see if this works in a few days, I suppose!  ;)<br>
