  Doggberry's School of Fencing is a limited box and will only be there for<br/>
only two more weekends! The stamp is handcarved and I'm really proud of it!<br/>
It's at Rennasaince Faire in Gilroy Ca. There's an addmission to get in, but<br/>
you don't have to only get the box. Spend the day there, I went today an<br/>
it's REALLY fun. I got my face painted and got to meet the queen! The people<br/>
that work at the booth would be very pleased if you got "ye olde letterbox".<br/>
