<br/>
<br/>
	I was in The City yesterday to run some errands and got around<br/>
to replanting Playland <br/>
	Lives! (finally). It is in a new location, which I hope won't be<br/>
quite as difficult to locate as <br/>
	the original spot. I also nabbed the Be a Hippy! and Sutro Bath<br/>
stamps. I attempted <br/>
	Quacky McLaren and was wondering if anyone else on the list has<br/>
tried this one. Following <br/>
	the clues put me in the middle of a grassy area, with no<br/>
likely-looking hiding spots <br/>
	nearby. Anyone have any comments on this one?<br/>
<br/>
	I've been meaning to put a shout out to Renee of 3CatFam for<br/>
playing chauffeur last week! <br/>
	Thanks for negotiating all those curves on Mt. Diablo. We did<br/>
some boxing out in Contra <br/>
	Costa county, and plan to do more. I got a peek at the stamps<br/>
for the Herding Cats series <br/>
	she is working on, and they will definitely be worth the 7.5<br/>
mile hike (I am waiting until <br/>
	they are all planted though - only want to do that hike once!)<br/>
<br/>
	Sleepy Cat and I also had some letterboxing adventures last<br/>
Friday. She hurt her leg and <br/>
	was not able to walk, so we cancelled our scheduled day in<br/>
Vacaville. Instead we did <br/>
	"carboxing," consisting of drive bys where I could bring the box<br/>
back to the car and we <br/>
	could stamp in there. It takes slackboxing to a whole new level!<br/>
We did a 300 mile <br/>
	roundtrip and managed to bag 12 finds. The new boxes out in the<br/>
Turlock/Hilmar area by <br/>
	TwoRoests are quite fun and worth the drive out there. I've been<br/>
there twice now, and <br/>
	every time I come back home, they've gone and planted more<br/>
boxes!<br/>
<br/>
	So, this period of unemployment has brought many letterboxing<br/>
opportunities. I am still <br/>
	planning on getting to Vacaville some time, and am up for some<br/>
group boxing - any word <br/>
	on that Black Cavalier? I am busy 1/27 and 2/3 but open other<br/>
days (even weekdays).<br/>
