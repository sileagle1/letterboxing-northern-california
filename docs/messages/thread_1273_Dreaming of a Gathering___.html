I think you would all have found this pretty amusing....<br/>
<br/>
The lettreboxers I invented, as well as the locations...<br/>
<br/>
The long, lanky gentleman with the astonishingly long legs, dressed in<br/>
black jeans, a white Edwardian dress shirt and an Edwardian hair<br/>
cut...The other gentleman who refused to take off his rubber werewolf<br/>
mask....Both were claiming to be OB Juan, of course.<br/>
<br/>
The hitherto undiscovered limestone cave systems that Sleepy Cat and I<br/>
found zillions of letterboxes in.<br/>
<br/>
And the fact that the whole dream has a particular Nick Cave song as<br/>
its soundtrack.  (The one where he sings about "the shores of Lake<br/>
Tahoooo" which may be a reference to ArtTrekker.)<br/>

hot. Most likely I will appear as Zorro... slim, of medium build and <br/>
quick of foot. I may be dressed in black or in my orininal Zorro <br/>
suit which is brown and much less romantic than the black costume <br/>
introduced by Hollywood.<br/>
<br/>
Have I ever told you that, as a youth, I was the greatest swordsman <br/>
in all of California. Actually this is not really saying very much <br/>
as there were, maybe, 1000 adult males between 20 and 40 in "all of <br/>
California" at that time...but it is fun to make the claim!<br/>
