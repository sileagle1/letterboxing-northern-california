Last month we had the pleasure of finding the first two of The St. Patrick Series letterboxes & it's true - the stamps are beautiful and the locations fabulous.  We had planned to find more letterboxes but got distracted by all the wonderful things to see and do.  We hope to make another trip back to the area later this year to pick up the rest of the series.<br>
 <br>
ALSO:  Last weekend, we had fun finding Princess Lea's mystery box Two Fathoms Deep.  We were surprised to be only the second to find - folks, you've really got to check this one out.  Excellent stamp and the area is beautiful and full of stuff to do.<br>
