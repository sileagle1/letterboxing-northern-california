                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went out to check on Shoreline Park today for suitable planting <br>
sites (and to find lisascenic's new box)and think it will be a swell <br>
place for a gathering. Area "C" will be fine for us but we would <br>
suggest a couple more tables and any camp or folding chairs you might <br>
want to bring along. We have a 6-foot table we'll bring and at least 2 <br>
chairs. Area "C" is partially shaded but it is not deep shade so <br>
umbrallas or anthing you can use for shade, keeping in mind the strong <br>
winds, will be advisable--hats and sunblock for sure!<br>
<br>
There was a birthday party going on when we were there and the hosts <br>
had strung crepe paper and balloons along their reserved site, <br>
delineating it nicely so others wouldn't be inclined to wander through <br>
it. I think this would be a nice idea for us. Anyone have any orange <br>
and lime green streamers and balloons? <br>

I'll go ahead and reserve it tomorrow.  It will be $72 to reserve, and<br>
while I don't require us to share this cost, I will accept donations<br>
towards this fee.  I repeat: this is NOT an obligation or requirement. <br>
Donate if you are able or want to.  Not donating won't be held against<br>
you.  I hope this seems fair to everyone.<br>
<br>
I think the idea of crepe tape to delineate our area is a great one.  I<br>
don't know if I will be able to arrive on site at 10am myself to hold the<br>
spot, but whoever ends up doing this should be the one to string the tape.<br>
<br>
I will bring as many as 4 camping chairs, provided they fit in my car. :)<br>
<br>
We WILL have a BBQ for the potluck!  Kathy, if you get a chance, can you<br>
send out a current potluck menu?<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for helping to bring this together.  I can't wait!<br>

True, we should all contribute to the costs of this event. However, rather than publish Eclipse's snail mail address online and have all of us send her piddly checks, why don't we have a "hat" at the event to collect these contributions with $5 as a suggested amount.

As for extra funds used for crepe paper, etc., I think we should just declare what each of us will bring with the idea that it will be our donation to the party. We already have the utensils and eating paraphernalia covered, the BBQ briquets, and a case of bottled water that I know of. What's everyone else willing to contribute?<br>

<br>
I went ahead and reserved Area C at MHSP for Sunday, August 27, for $72. <br>
This does have a BBQ pit and there will be a BBQ!<br>
<br>
Someone needs to be at the site between 10-10:30 am to physically claim it<br>
for the day.  Nobody will be there to do it for us and there is nowhere to<br>
check in, we just need to be there by then to stake the claim.  We don't<br>
need to figure out right now who that should be, but if anyone wants to<br>
volunteer, that's fine too. :)<br>
<br>
I want to stress again that I don't think anyone should feel obligated to<br>
pay as part of attending this event.  I think one of the great things<br>
about Letterboxing is that participation doesn't require dues, fees, or<br>
lots of expensive equipment; another is that it has a vibrant community of<br>
people who enjoy coming together and doing things for each other, such as<br>
giving advice, planting letterboxes, and manning the grill!  I will pass<br>
the hat and ask participants to give if they can, but not to feel<br>
obligated.  I don't want to presume upon anyone's financial situation or<br>
make anyone feel as though they cannot participate, and I feel certain<br>
that things will balance out anyway.<br>
<br>
I also agree with the idea of divvying up any remaining money to reimburse<br>
anyone who laid out a lot on the potluck, such as for grillables,<br>
plates/napkins/etc, or whatever else we determine appropriate.. I'm sure<br>
it'll work out when we get there.<br>
<br>
Kathy, when you get a chance, we'd still like to see the menu so far!  I<br>
haven't yet committed to bringing anything and I'd like to see what is<br>
still needed.  Thanks!<br>
