&gt; I've already got a couple of ideas for box placements.  I really <br/>
&gt; thought the Aeroplane Pilot box was well done because it seemed to <br/>
&gt; also tie into the owner's interest in RC airplanes.  So, being a <br/>
&gt; homebrewing, I'm now trying to figure out how to place boxes near <br/>
&gt; brewpubs in the Sacramento area even though they are mostly <br/>
&gt; commercial areas.<br/>

I was back east over Thanksgiving and went 'boxing.  One of the <br/>
letterboxes was in an urban area.  The placer used two black film <br/>
canisters duct-taped bottom to bottom.  One side held the stamp, the <br/>
other end held the logbook, which was an adding machine roll of paper <br/>
that fit into the canister exactly.  The whole assemblage was then <br/>
velcroed with black velcro into the branches of an evergreen tree.  <br/>
Very clever and quite hidden from casual view.  Something to <br/>
consider.  Or you could do the Dartmoor thing and plant the boxes <br/>
with the bartender--seekers only have to ask the bartender for the <br/>
box and purchase a pint as a courtesy.<br/>
