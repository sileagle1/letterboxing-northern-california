                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK -- I see I have enough interest (minimum of 3 people) to go ahead<br/>
with the class. NOW, to find the best date on a January weekend, from<br/>
about 1:00 - 3:00 PM (giving you some time afterwards to catch up on<br/>
"Cabinet" boxes, if desired).<br/>
<br/>
If you want to attend, e-mail me directly at pgonyea @ earthlink .net<br/>
-- (remove the spaces) with your 1st and 2nd choices from these 4 dates:<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, Jan. 5<br/>
Sunday, Jan. 6<br/>
Saturday, Jan. 12<br/>
Sunday, Jan. 13<br/>
<br/>
(after those dates I may be in Florida)<br/>
<br/>
If you have a specific question about preparing images that you'd like<br/>
me to answer, send them along -- or attach an image that you'd like to<br/>
see me work with. I'll do my best to help prepare them for carving. <br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that not all images are suitable, even with using<br/>
PhotoShop to manipulate them. But PhotoShop helps a lot, by increasing<br/>
contrast, limiting gray tones, and with sizing. While there are a<br/>
couple of techniques already published on the Web, I'll show you some<br/>
additional ways to work towards an image you can carve. <br/>
<br/>
I'll also prepare a handout for you to take home with you.<br/>
<br/>
My event/personal traveler letterbox, "Tabula Rasa" will be also be<br/>
available. Directions are at:<br/>
