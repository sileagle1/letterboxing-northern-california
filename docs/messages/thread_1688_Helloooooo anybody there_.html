<br/>
Yep, been pretty quiet. I did a great trip to Arizona and Utah in<br/>
April (got to catch up on a bunch of boxes and hiking in the Moab<br/>
area), before the price of gas went up to $4 (now $4.50+ in South<br/>
Tahoe). So now I'm pretty hunkered down &amp; working, trying to conserve<br/>
resources. Waffling about going to Monterey, but probably won't make<br/>
it. Employee issues/training at work...summer is our busy season.<br/>
I hope everyone is doing well, too, and maybe I'll get to see a bunch<br/>
of you in Oregon.<br/>

We spent the Springtime hunting many of the boxes placed by vigorous <br/>
placers in the north Bay area.  We head out tomorrow on a cross country <br/>
roadtrip (thank you Prius) on our way to join the letterboxing cruise <br/>
to Bermuda in a couple of a weeks.  We are eager to sample boxes across <br/>
the country, and leave a few in our wake.  Hope our trails cross soon.<br/>

I'm around too.  I just got back from camping in Big Sur.  I found the 4 boxes in the park while I was there.  I was going to try for some drive bys on the way home, but my clues fell out of my pocket somewhere on the trail.  I feel HORRIBLE for littering.  I feel even worse that someone may find my litter and trash the boxes.  I'm hoping whomever finds my trash, becomes a boxer instead.  Sigh...<br/>
<br/>
Only 4 more days until summer break!!!  Whoo-hoo!!!!!!<br/>
