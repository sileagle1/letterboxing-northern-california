That is the correct answer, maybe you typed it in wrong?  That <br/>
happened to me when I did the kimball library box...typed in the <br/>
correct answer wrong, got an error message and instead of carefully <br/>
typing it in a second time I started trying all sorts of other <br/>
possible answers and got off on the wrong track.  About a week later <br/>
I looked at it again, typed in my original answer and it worked!  <br/>
This is the URL I used and fo tto the last challenge...you have <br/>
probably already gotten there yourself.   <br/>
<br/>
If you have not solved the final puzzle, I am happy to give you a <br/>
hint...it took me about half an hour to figure out solving the <br/>
entire thing would take forever but there is a trick.........<br/>
<br/>
Here it is Sunday eve and never made it to Cloverdale...we decided <br/>
to go to the beach instead and it was gorgeous!  One of the nicest <br/>
days at the beach I can remember.  I did go check on breaching <br/>
whale/SeaCreature #4 and found it right were I left it.  Two other <br/>
people had too...and I noticed some definite footsteps up to the <br/>
coyote bush....so I need to move that box to a better place that <br/>
wont damage the vegetation.  Not a very good place to begin with but <br/>
it was a rainy day and I was running out of time and just wanted to <br/>
find a home...so if you are ever out that way again and go for it  <br/>
recheck the clues because they will change. That was my only <br/>
letterboxing experience for the weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
But I did get alot done in the yard!  I was even thinking of <br/>
planting a drive by letterbox in my front yard, but that might be <br/>
too wierd for people!<br/>
