I think that I would be more inclined to make the January 8th shindig <br>
than NOV-DEC.  Way to much going on these 2 months, and I need all <br>
the  $$$$ I can get for the holidays.  Right at the moment i have <br>
nothing to make a stamp with. I actually bought the kit at Micheals <br>
when I first got into this.  It came with the pink stuff and the <br>
carver.  I have made my first stamp and  even did a second but I just <br>
am not that happy with them. We only use the 1.  I do carry the <br>
other  one with us just in case.  I took Aileens craft glue and glued <br>
a block on the back to use as a handle.  Works good but all the other <br>
stamps I have seen seem to be so much cleaner.  This is where the <br>
carving party comes in for me.  So count me in. I would love to come, <br>
learn and meet as many fellow LB's.   Just let me know when- where -<br>
and what I need to bring with me. ( a dish in case we decided to have <br>
a mini gathering in here?) I am sure somewhere out here on this <br>
internet is a cool place that has some cute things to make into a <br>
stamp.  <br>
