There are parts that are STEEP!!!! Feels like straight<br>
up. Then up some more. Then, oh, up some more! The<br>
advice given to me re: getting Sideways and Planet<br>
Walk in one trek was to do PW till just past Saturn,<br>
then detour onto Gray Pine Trail to do Sideways, then<br>
take Brushy Peaks Trail (pay attention to this name,<br>
especially the second word) back to PW and do Pluto,<br>
Neptune and Uranus in that order. That is all fine and<br>
good. Start out first thing in the morning and give<br>
yourself all day so you don't have to try to hurry any<br>
part of it like some of us did. I am a backpacker from<br>
way back and sneer a little when I see people using<br>
the double walking stick technique of hiking. I'll<br>
tell ya, I wish we'd each had a pair for this hike.<br>
Especially for the downhills.<br>
<br>
You might want to do the series(es) separately, thus<br>
avoiding the gnarly traverse between the top of<br>
Sideways and the top of PW. Do one one day, and one<br>
the next. But maybe the steepness of PW alone is bad<br>
enough to make it preferable to do them together. I<br>
think only da Kool Kats and Mim would know. All of<br>
Mim's SLRSP boxes are alive and well, as well as<br>
Abamit and her Shadow. Mim says wine country series<br>
(at SLRSP) is missing boxes 2 & 3.<br>
<br>
A lovely little (much more tame!) series for before or<br>
after the killer ones is The Four Seasons.  Very nice.<br>
No soreness.<br>
<br>
Have fun!!!<br>
<br>
aT<br>
<br>
p.s. many of PW's boxes are a great size in which to<br>
fit hitchhikers!<br>
