                    <div class="plaintext-content">I managed to get the first of the Greek Wind deities done in time <br>
for the weekend. This box is Notus, the South Wind, harbinger of <br>
rain and fog, and son of Eos, the goddess of the dawn. There will be <br>
more winged wind gods scattered around the city.<br>
<br>
'Notus' marks my 25th planted letterbox! HOORAY!!!<br>
<br>
I wanted to return to LbNCA letterboxing with a big splash, so I <br>
worked hard to get three new boxes done this week. I'll also be <br>
replacing the previously geotrashed "Nepenthe' soon and putting it <br>
in a somewhat different spot, away from the neighboring geocache.<br>
<br>
'Notus, the South Wind' has a large hinged folding stamp, as <br>
does 'Star-Crossed' (retiring 8/15), 'Ortus Depths', and 'Magritte: <br>
The Therapeutist'.<br>
<br>
Get blown away!<br>
