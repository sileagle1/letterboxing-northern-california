<br>
"A box can be counted as Found more than once if the preceding apply,<br>
and its clue, location, and stamp image have all changed since Found the<br>
first time."<br>
<br>
So according to this, the Judah box wouldn't be a counted as a Find for<br>
those that found it at the GRR (DoubleSaj & Old Blue were always the<br>
rebels).  But, this begs the question, if the stamp, location & clue has<br>
changed, what's left to make it the same box?  I guess the log book &<br>
physical box could be the same, but if it's a new stamp, I'd assume<br>
there'd be a new log book.  So, I don't see how all these things could<br>
change & still be somehow considered the same box.  I guess if a box had<br>
been vandalized & the stamp was lost, but the book was still there, then<br>
the box could be moved to a better hiding spot & a new stamp carved.<br>
The "new" box would still have some continuity with the original box,<br>
but count as a new find.<br>

Today I finally replanted the last of my Old Sac boxes that were<br>
pulled--Pony Express Postmark.<br>
<br>
But I have a question: I think I deleted the post, but did Doublesaj say<br>

We planted the Judah box for the GGR event and pulled it when it was over. We <br>
took the box to another county and totally rewrote the clues then planted it <br>
again. The only difference between it being a totally new plant is that the <br>
stamp is the same. I guess that's lazy on our part but we really like the stamp <br>
and don't want it to go to 'waste'. You still have to decipher new clues and <br>
drive to the site and find it. We'd call that a new F!<br>

I generally count something as a new Find if it is a new stamp in a new <br>
location, even if the clues are still sorta the same.  For example, <br>
Amanda's original Dirty Harry box went missing.  When she recarved it, <br>
she used a different image and put it in a slightly safer location, so <br>
I counted it as a new find.  This Judah one is trickier though - same <br>
stamp, new location, new clues.  Since I didn't really do the work the <br>
first time I found it (stumbled across it while I was looking for a <br>
totally different box in Sacto) maybe I shouldn't have counted it the <br>
first time since I didn't do the work of solving that long and <br>
complicated puzzle!  As you all know, we do what we want when we are <br>
deciding what to count,  so it's up to you to decide what is "right."<br>
