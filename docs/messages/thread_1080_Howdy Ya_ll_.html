                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted you all to know- HAROLD AND MAUDE will<br>
eventually be completed- hopefully this summer.<br>
<br>
I haven't died off or anything, I have just had a<br>
miserable sinus/asthma thing since Nov 1 and a<br>
boatload of "stuff" with which to deal.  <br>
<br>
Also, on a non-letterboxing note:  Both my husband and<br>
I were laid off in 2005 (yahoo for luck!) and I still<br>
have only found PT work.  I live in the Antioch area<br>
and am willing to commute.<br>
<br>
If anyone has connections in the INSURANCE, CUSTOMER<br>
SERVICE, WRITING/EDITING, TUTORING businesses, I would<br>
appreciate it.  Lack of funds is curtailing my<br>
letterboxing and we can't have that now, can we?<br>
<br>
Lol in the midst of despair and still trying to carve<br>
out a decent stamp,<br>
