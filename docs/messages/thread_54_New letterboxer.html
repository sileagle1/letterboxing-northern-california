<br/>
I just wanted to introduce myself since I just discovered <br/>
letterboxing a short while ago. In fact, I found several letterboxes <br/>
over the past weekend: the one at Mission City Memorial Park and <br/>
Princess Lea's Haunted Mansion series! I was really happy to finally <br/>
find some since I was unsuccessful the first two times I tried to go <br/>
letterboxing (however, I did enjoy the trails!). Anyway, at Mission <br/>
City Memorial, I met the friend of the planter, so it was really cool <br/>
to meet another letterboxer. I hope to meet more!<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to find more letterboxes, and when I get a better feel <br/>
for it, I'll be sure to plant some boxes for others to find. I'm also <br/>
interested in making some hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
