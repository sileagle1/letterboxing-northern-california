But in looking at the park map, where is the picnic area?  Oh, I see it,<br/>
just southwest of the Fountian.  It looks like a pretty big place.  Is<br/>
there a generally recommended area to consider hiding boxes in?  I've<br/>
heard that the Golden Gate Gathering had the trouble that the boxes were<br/>
so spread out, the attendees didn't see each other again once the clues<br/>
were handed out in the morning.  I didn't specifically see it lised in<br/>
the AQ schedule, but I liked the way we came back together at the Gold<br/>
Rush Romp idea at the end of the day for dessert, story swapping &amp; final<br/>
exchanges.  <br/>
