                    <div class="plaintext-content">I headed out this afternoon to replace a couple of missing boxes <br>
from my Los Osos Oaks boxes.  (The Oak Tree and Butterfly boxes were <br>
missing.)  At long last, I have replaced the two boxes!  So if you <br>
missed either of them your last time out, now's your chance!<br>
<br>
On an unrelated matter, I pulled box #2 (the spiderweb) for <br>
mainenance.  The box was packed full of JUNK (Ralph cards, sunflower <br>
seeds, random pices of paper, a rusty pen, etc.) and the logbook was <br>
soaking wet since it wasn't placed in a Ziplock bag (even though <br>
there was still one left in the container).  It should be back <br>
within the next week or so, though, healthier than ever.<br>
<br>
The worm letterbox for some bizarre reason was full of peanuts.  Not <br>
the kind you find in boxes, but real, edible peanuts.  I don't know <br>
who put them there, but PLEASE, let's not put ANY food into a <br>
letterbox.  I'd prefer if nobody put ANYTHING in any of my boxes <br>
except for perhaps a pen, but food?  Come on--it's going to attract <br>
animals that will try to eat their way into the container!  Sadly, I <br>
fear the culprits responsible probably aren't on these talk lists, <br>
but I figured it never hurts to remind others to use some common <br>
sense.<br>
<br>
And, on yet another note, someone had put in a stand-in box for the <br>
missing butterfly box with a note that said the butterfly box was <br>
missing.  I hope you don't mind, but since I replaced the butterfly <br>
box, I moved the container to the worm box which was starting to <br>
fall apart.  Now the worm box is in tip-top shape, but I did use the <br>
stand-in box that someone left for the butterfly box and if you want <br>
your box back, let me know!  I can still replace the worm box with <br>
another one on my next visit out there.<br>
<br>
Carpe diem!<br>
