                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a matter of fact, I just bought some of this paper online - commonly <br/>
called "waterslide" decals - and they were delivered today.  I purchased <br/>
from beldecal.com because for $17, I got a 40 page mix of white and clear <br/>
papers - I wasn't sure which would be best for my needs (I'm helping <br/>
detail the guitar my fiance recently rebuilt).<br/>
<br/>
If you need to buy them locally, I would suggest possibly trying model <br/>
train hobbyist stores - decals are popular with them for train <br/>
personalization and detailing.  I've not had any luck finding them in most <br/>
local art stores... though if you go regularly like me, it's worth <br/>
checking from time to time to see if anyone has started carrying them..<br/>
<br/>
Lisa, being the uber-crafty goddess, might know more than I about where to <br/>
find them locally.. Jen might also know, as she is also super-crafty. :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy crafting!<br/>
