Hi everyone.   Well Jeff and I went out on our first LB excursion.  <br/>
WE set out with 6 Letterboxes to do.  Due to some unusual <br/>
curcumstances when heading to SF to do 4 of them we ended up only <br/>
doing Columba.  Wow what a great Hybrid this one was. Our thanks to <br/>
bthomas. So we then decided to skip the rest of the SF ones and head <br/>
out to Alien is Lost.  I have been wanting to do this one since we <br/>
found out about LBing. WE were able to find box 2 &amp; 3 but #1 seems to <br/>
be MIA!   :(  After this long journey we decided to try for Oompa <br/>
Loompa but by the time we hit Peteluma it was getting dark.  So next <br/>
time.Maybe when we head out to Healdsburg Quartet.  Sounds like fun. <br/>
Our thanks to Alien Explorers for a great afternoon.<br/>

We definately couldnt see it from the path,and cuz we couldnt, we made sure to hide it just as well.. Mustve been the finder before us hid it so well, so we did the same. I guess its better not found than missing/taken???? <br/>
