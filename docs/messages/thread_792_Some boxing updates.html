                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got motivated to go for Walk for Marfan by Bonedoc.  What a <br/>
beautiful hike in a most wonderful spot and all the boxes are in <br/>
great shape!  None of the containers were tupperware...rather cute <br/>
tins and other boxes that pertained to the theme.  Very impressive <br/>
Bonedoc!  <br/>
<br/>
I just got a note from a person, who stumbled on the remains of a <br/>
very sturdy tupperware (Optical Illusions BOx 1).  She said, "I did <br/>
find shards of what the container looked like scattered all over the <br/>
ground. It seems like a curious animal or a really angry person got <br/>
to the box and destroyed it."  Anyway, s/he foudn enough of the <br/>
label to log onto atlasquest and emailed me via the link, after <br/>
going to find the other 3 boxes in the series.   Good news: another <br/>
boxer in Sonoma County, bad news: a really angry person who destroys <br/>
boxes.  Of course, it was proabably just an animal but the image of <br/>
a person destroying a box was rather amusing or scary depending on <br/>
your mood.<br/>
<br/>
I also had the good fortune to go for Lea's Egypt Walk, only got the <br/>
second box but a great spot to check out.  Hopefully we will be back <br/>
in San jose to do more boxing sometime this summer.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Mimulus. I am glad to know that all 4 boxes in Walk for Marfan are<br/>
still doing well since I planted them in the winter (while it was raining)<br/>
and I have no idea what the foliage looks like now. I had fun making those.<br/>
Every February, I will add more boxes under the same theme. I may lead you<br/>
further up the path to another beautiful spot, still within the same area.<br/>
