<br/>
This is my first post, but I have been in the background listening...<br/>
<br/>
While I admire all you great stamp-carvers, I have to admit a bit of <br/>
jealousy.  You see, I consider myself to be one of the least <br/>
artistic beings on the planet and I am very dangerous with anything <br/>
sharp.<br/>
My 4-year-old is a better artist than her mommy. <br/>
<br/>
This is why I have focused on attempting to be <br/>
humorous/clever/bizarre in my clues (I do do a little WRITING on the <br/>
side). If nothing else I try to make my box designs a bit out of the <br/>
ordinary and I leave little treats for the finders.  All this in an <br/>
attempt to make up for my disappointing "carve-less" stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I decided to TRY a stamp myself.  I enjoy crafting so I <br/>
thought-"I can make a CLAY stamp of a basic sunflower for my HAROLD <br/>
and MAUDE series."<br/>
<br/>
Giddy with excitement, I purchased some SCULPEY clay and set to <br/>
work, transferring a sunflower design onto the soft clay, carefully <br/>
cutting it out and baking it.<br/>
<br/>
The flower looked simple, but great!  SCULPEY dries to a firm, yet <br/>
pliable consistency, so mounting it was a snap.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, SCULPEY also dries to a non-porous, smooth surface <br/>
which would not hold ink. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!  All my efforts were <br/>
in vain- the stamp is cute, but useless.<br/>

<br/>
Glad to have you in our midst, and I agree that you should not beat <br/>
yourself up so much about carving!  In fact, come to the next gathering <br/>
and we will show you how easy it is (either that or we'll show the 4 <br/>
year old).  I am very impressed by your clues and locations - let's get <br/>
some stamps in there and you will be a triple threat!  In the mean <br/>
time, I have seen some stamps made of those foam sheets and they work <br/>
passably<br/>

Have you tried the flexible Sculpey, or Liquid Sculpey? I don't know <br/>
if they'd work, but it's worth experimenting, and that'd be the next 2 <br/>
things I'd try...<br/>
