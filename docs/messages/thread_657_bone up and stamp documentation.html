than that. But it's not quite neccesary to bring a cadaver book like<br/>
Princess Lea either. Was she going to share the book with folks before or<br/>
after the icecream?? Yummie.<br/>
Besides...some of you may like the stamp on the forehead look. Aren't you<br/>
100+ finders getting sick of book stamping (kidding)? Hey, maybe we should<br/>
do shirt stamping. Too bad it'll wash out. <br/>
I keep a photo album of all of our LBxing trips. I will just bring a page<br/>
from it and have everyone stamp it to represent our gathering day in Sac.<br/>
Actually, I'll bring the album if anyone wants to see it and see the places<br/>
(and your own stamps) we've been to.<br/>
Think bones...<br/>
