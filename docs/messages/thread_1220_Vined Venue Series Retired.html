                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Vined Venue Series of Letterboxes in Ripon is retired as of 20 <br/>
June 2006.  The winter rains changed many of the landmarks.  The vines <br/>
are overgrown to the point of obscuring some trails.  And the <br/>
mosquitos are incredibly bothersome.  Two boxes were missing, one was <br/>
unobtainable, and two we removed.  They will probably go searching for <br/>
you as hitchhikers in the future.<br/>
