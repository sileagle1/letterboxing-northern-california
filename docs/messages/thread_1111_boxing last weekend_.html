It seems that there were several people boxing in the Berkeley Oakland <br/>
area this past weekend.  (My apologies to the folks who were stymied <br/>
by my letterboxes.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes!! We went to Berkeley / Oakland and got Robb's 2 Lake Merritt boxes  <br/>
(exquisite carvings!!), Lisascenic's Mini-Mystery in Berkeley and she and Robb's  <br/>
newest, Aquatic Park box (first finders), Princess Lea's Arukan and  <br/>
Blackbird's Volcano. We met up with some pretty powerful mud on a couple of them  but <br/>
were prepared.<br/>
<br/>
We also planted a box but we've dedicating it to Robb and will only be  <br/>
giving him and Lisascenic the clues until they are able to retrieve it. <br/>
<br/>
Sinus infections are nasty. Hope your daughter's all better soon!<br/>

We weren't sure which way to do the loop either! We ended up going  what we <br/>
think is the short route (although it was VERY muddy) and coming back  the same <br/>
way we came.<br/>

<br/>
I'm new to this list (thanks Lisa) but have been LB'ing around the Bay<br/>
Area for about a year now!  You might've seen my old stamp (looks like<br/>
a Bosch scene) or my new stamp (a Japanese Mon-style crest) in one of<br/>
your boxes in SF, Santa Cruz, or along Highway 1.<br/>
<br/>
In reference to the lovely weekend mentioned in the original post<br/>
here, I made it out to Sutro Heights park and had a lovely time. <br/>
There were tons of kites along Ocean Beach and it was just an<br/>
amazingly gorgeous day.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to hear more about a Sonoma gathering.. I'd love to meet some<br/>
of you there. :)<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Eclipse<br/>
