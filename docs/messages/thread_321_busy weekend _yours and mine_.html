your Lb pals decide to yak it up on the group board.<br>
I'm supposed to be working, but no, I'm indulging yet<br>
again in this double life I've begun. Trying to catch<br>
up with all the new posts.<br>
<br>
New finds: Went to Auburn & found three nice easy<br>
boxes--Old Auburn a particularly nice stamp. Didn't<br>
know about Lemony Snicket yet. Travelled to Lincoln to<br>
visit Penni's Lincoln & haunted house, but I was too<br>
early for the latter (duh, I wasn't thinking), so I<br>
missed my first possible exchange and also possible<br>
fright-induced incontinence. Went to Grass Valley and<br>
had a nice walk just before sunset to find Empire Mine<br>
box, then to Nevada City to see some ladies of the<br>
evening. (Just for conversation, mind you.) It was<br>
fully dark at this point, and instead of turning for<br>
home, we went to see the play "The Nerd" (not the<br>
Steve Martin one, unfortunately) by the Foothill<br>
Theater Company. The sets and acting were good, but<br>
the play sucked! I think we were the only ones who<br>
thought so. It was just so weird. We left at<br>
intermission, spent the night in a funny little motel<br>
on Hwy 49, then found Lone Grave in the morning.<br>
<br>
Travelled up Hwy 80 and tramped up through knee-deep<br>
snow to find First Cabin. This was my second attempt<br>
(it got dark on me the first time), and when I found<br>
the box, some finders complained in the log book that<br>
it was a hard find. I thought the clues were pretty<br>
great, but I have a couple of ideas, so I'll send<br>
those to the placer. Also did second attempt for I-80<br>
Box #2, don't know why I'm having so much trouble<br>
finding this one. Can't seem to find the right Vista<br>
Point.<br>
<br>
Re scanning the log of a microbox: my feeling is that<br>
the log should be for finders' eyes only. Would there<br>
be a way to set it up with a password that you plant<br>
in the box, so that only finders would have access to<br>
it?<br>
<br>
Re gathering in Old Sac & stamp demo: I'm definitely<br>
up for both of these events. Late April (after Lea's<br>
exams) is perfect for me--I help run a seasonal<br>
landscape nursery, and by May we are rockin' (think Da<br>
Kool Kats in early April) and then it is hard for me<br>
to get away before the second half of July. Old Sac<br>
sounds great, and if we agree on this location I will<br>
get busy planting, planting, planting! I think there<br>
must be bunches of great locations there. I don't know<br>
how much I can do to help with planning, but I could<br>
be on call on an as available basis. (How's that for<br>
hedging?) The stamp demo could be fun, too, I just<br>
don't know what my availability will be for the next<br>
few months. Just read Mimulus' post regarding<br>
demo--I'd do my best to be there! (My mom lives in<br>
Healdsburg and always likes a visit). (Also to<br>
Mimulus: around the 28th of September, I tried to find<br>
Twine Country, but to no avail. Do you know if it is<br>
alive and well?)<br>
<br>
Re new boxes vs. hitchhikers: hmmm, which is better, a<br>
hundred dollars in twenties or ninety -nine dollars in<br>
ones? I love new boxes, but I also love the surprise<br>
of finding a hitchhiker, and take it seriously that it<br>
is under my care. I think if it is too much for<br>
someone to entrust herself with the care and feeding<br>
of a hitchhiker, she should just leave it in place for<br>
the next finder. Pretend it wasn't there. Some of us<br>
love them!! I found one this weekend that actually has<br>
its own box, so now I have to find its next hostel. My<br>
planting thus far kind of follows these guidelines: to<br>
commemorate a place, I plant a box. To commemorate an<br>
event, a day, or a person, I plant a hitchhiker.<br>
Personally, a hitchhiker is a vicarious way for me to<br>
get around to all kinds of cool places, visit with fun<br>
people and see some art! Of course, I do also have<br>
that pang when I send it out in the world perhaps<br>
never to be seen again, but I know that is the risk I<br>
take with a HH. My only other thought on this is that<br>
I certainly do not want the number of HHs to exceed<br>
boxes! So I plant more boxes than HHs.<br>
<br>
Ok, I really do have work to do.<br>
