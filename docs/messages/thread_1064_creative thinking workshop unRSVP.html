it turns out we'ew not going to be able to make it.  I just returned from 36<br>
hours sitting next to Zaira's hospital bed while the doctors try to decide<br>
wether or not she has appendecitis.  She's still there, but I needed to take<br>
care of some business here at home since I can't get online from the<br>
hospital.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wanted to let y'all (and especially Paul) know that the two of us<br>
will not be able to make it.  I hope it is a wonderful time for all.<br>
