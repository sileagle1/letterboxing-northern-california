<br/>
  A good plan. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;Been doing any 'boxing lately?<br/>
<br/>
  No boxing...the weather's been so pretty &amp; I have two ski passes  &amp; hadn't skied till last week, so I've been skiing this week. Two  friends (also employees) took me down some challenging stuff at  Heavenly on Tuesday. One is ten years younger, the other twenty (she  could be my daughter, yikes!!!), both very strong, so I was the old  lady on the hill. But they were patient with me. Wednesday at Kirkwood  with Mill Valley friends, another fabulous day, but tried to stay more  in the cruising lane. Today a dear friend and I went up to Heavenly and  were having fun till she hit a hard spot and pulled some ligaments in  her knee. Ouch. She'll be in a brace for a week or so; I hope she won't  need surgery.<br/>
<br/>
  Monday before all the downhill I took the dogs to Hope Valley for a X-C ski in the afternoon, ahh, divine. Bluebird days, here.<br/>
<br/>
  Now I need to get some work done. Would have liked to go to Sonoma with  youse guys! Thinking about getting outta dodge on Sunday...Sutter  Buttes? But I haven't brought it up with John, and he knows I need to  get to work, too. So he might frown on it. We'll see. <br/>
<br/>
  Happy days, Kel<br/>
