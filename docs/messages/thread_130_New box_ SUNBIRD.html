                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I had my best friend visiting me from Key West I just HAD to <br/>
introduce her to letterboxing. So we hunted down Princess <br/>
Lea's "Where the Buffalo Roam" and we planted this new box, called <br/>
Sunbird. Of course, she's now indoctrinated.<br/>
<br/>
The Sunbird box sits in a location with gorgeous sweeping views of <br/>
San Francisco. It's waiting for you. Be sure to wear your strong <br/>
vision eyeglasses when you go to look at the clues. [EVIL GRIN]<br/>
<br/>
Also, it's been reported (and now confirmed) that my new "Yes, Noe" <br/>
box is missing. Someone appreciated a thing of beauty and took it <br/>
for themselves... but what goes around, comes around. I'll be <br/>
replacing it very soon. (Thanks for the report of my vanished box, <br/>
Amanda from Seattle!)<br/>
<br/>
I've been recruiting new letterboxers, and I'm now hearing that a <br/>
number of folks are ready to jump in! San Francisco will soon have <br/>
doubled in its number of letterboxes... and we'll keep plantin' and <br/>
huntin'!<br/>

Works for me!  Just curious.  =)  I think my favorite letter I've <br/>
seen is R for Rescues.  I'm still at R0, however.  One of these <br/>
days....<br/>

Yikes!  No kidding!  =)  I ended up using the Magnifier on Windows <br/>
to read it more easily!  Is this what it feels like to get old?!<br/>
