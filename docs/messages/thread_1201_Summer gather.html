We think it would be a great idea to schedule the gathering around CR. <br>
Best date for us would be Sunday, July 29th. I'm scheduled to teach a <br>
quilting class on the 28th.<br>
 <br>
How does July 29th work for everyone else? <br>

time for a gathering for me, personally.  I could do dinner, but I'll be<br>
out of town part of July and again in early August and I just don't have<br>
the resources during this time that I'd want to organize a gathering,<br>
prepare a box, etc.<br>
<br>
My vote stays with end of August - but that's just my vote. :)  If the<br>
majority votes for July, that's fine, but I may have to scale back on<br>
organization if that's the case.  I want to be able to help as best I can,<br>
but don't want to overcommit myself.<br>
