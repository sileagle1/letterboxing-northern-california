worked on the complex route through SF's streets that are to become <br/>
the path through the 'Minotaur's Maze' to the letterbox. Up to now, <br/>
the weather hasn't inspired me to sit at intersections, creating <br/>
clues through the 'labyrinth'. I tried last week and I got fog-<br/>
chilled. <br/>
<br/>
I need to maintain my reputation for boxes that make you think and <br/>
work (and that means work &amp; extra planning for me first). For this <br/>
one, decision points at intersections are questions posed by the <br/>
evil half man, half bull minotaur. They fall into 3 categories: <br/>
Victorian house architecture, San Francisco trees (which mostly <br/>
originate from Australia &amp; New Zealand), and the origin of common <br/>
sayings that come from Greek mythology. <br/>
<br/>
I'll have reference materials (photos) on a web page so you can <br/>
learn to distinguish Stick Victorian houses from Queen Anne houses, <br/>
and lemon bottlebrush trees from New Zealand Christmas trees. The <br/>
phrases you'll have to figure out or research on your own before you <br/>
head out the door.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to keep the path off of the busier streets, so you can <br/>
pull over, identify trees or houses, and answer the question, then <br/>
know which direction to take from there.<br/>
<br/>
On my route plotting trip today, I met 2 fellows who have lived in <br/>
SF for a long time, and knew lots of off-the-beaten-path places in <br/>
the city. They gave me some great ideas, and best of all, a surprise <br/>
ending place for the maze! I also have some good ideas for future <br/>
box locations that are generally people-free.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great project for these weeks that I'm on sabbatical from <br/>
work. Soon I'll unleash the minotaur on LbNCA, and see who's smart <br/>
and clever enough to vanquish him!<br/>
