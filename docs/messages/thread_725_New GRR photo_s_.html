Last night I spent some time setting up a new folder of GRR photos that I<br/>
had taken. Today I checked on it and oddly enough, it is now combined with<br/>
the other GRR pix in the GRR folder. Weird. Oh well. Please click on "show<br/>
all" to see all of the photos because now there are a lot in that folder.<br/>
The ones labeled lb-oldsa.. are the ones I put in last night. I did "create<br/>
a new album" and I labeled it and it did exist...but today, a different<br/>
story. Well, I hope they are still there for you to see. There are some good<br/>
ones of you guys.<br/>

Dunno if I qualify as a gremlin, but I've certainly been called worse. =)<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to keep all pictures with the same theme together. It can<br/>
get confusing after a dozen events spread out across three dozen<br/>
folders, so I've been moving all GRR photos to the same folder. I've<br/>
also started shrinking some of the larger ones since it appears<br/>
bonedoc ran out of room while uploading her pictures. (It was using<br/>
30.1 megabytes out of a quota of 30.0 megabytes!) I've freed about<br/>
about five more megabytes with more on the way, though, so if anyone<br/>
else has more photos, go ahead and start uploading them again! (Please<br/>
try to resize them so they don't take up more than about 50K each. A<br/>
couple of large photos can easily fill up the entire 5 megs that are<br/>
now available!)<br/>
