I received an e-mail today from a Park Ranger at Sycamore Grove in <br>
Livermore, where three of my letterboxes are placed. This Ranger was <br>
writing me because he ran into some "very nice ladies" who were <br>
letterboxing in the park, and he went to the website to see what <br>
they were up to. :-) <br>
<br>
This is usually the time when placers start seeing visions of <br>
missing boxes...<br>
<br>
But instead, the Ranger congratulated me on my "excellent <br>
directions" and offered me more history and background for the <br>
structures I mention in the clues! Isn't that wonderful? Three <br>
cheers for the Sycamore Grove Park Rangers!<br>
