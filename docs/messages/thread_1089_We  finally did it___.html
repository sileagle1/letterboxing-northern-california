confused about a couple of things.  The first attempt to add the <br>
letterbox I checked the wrong box.  so disregard the first entry that <br>
you have to link to it.  I cannot make it work.  So I redid it.  MY <br>
second boo boo was I have myself down as nickname when I signed up as <br>
MIchelle.  Was supposed to be BootZoo-Crew.  So both of these 2 are <br>
listed with Michelle.  Anyone tell me if I can fix that on these 2 LB?  <br>
I did go back and edit so next ones I place will have BZC> Also how <br>
does one put them on AQ?<br>
Anyway the Letterboxes we placed yesterday are called<br>
Cramped in a Can and Zoo with a view.  Let me know what you think and <br>
any comments are most welcome.  Thanks<br>

You will have to sign up as BootZoo-Crew, delete the boxes under <br>
Michelle and repost them under BootZoo-Crew.If you do this then you <br>
will have another URL(see below)<br>

<br>
You need to edit "Can" it is guard not gaurd.<br>
<br>
 Also how <br>
> does one put them on AQ?<br>
<br>
Simple, just go to AQ and pull down 'add a box', type in all of the <br>
info stuff then type in the URL in the proper spot.<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br>
boxnum=20493&boxname=Cramped_in_a_Can<br>
<br>
After you enter all the stuff then double check the links by trying <br>
them out.<br>
