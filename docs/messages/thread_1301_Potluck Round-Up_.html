<br>
This list shows a BBQ master, BBQ utensils and some hotdogs/veggie dogs <br>
- but do we have any other grillables?  Is anyone planning on bringing <br>
burgers or anything like that?  If not, I'll step up - but if so, please <br>
speak up and let us know.  I'd be happy to fill in any gaps in our meal!<br>
<br>
Can't wait to see you all on Sunday!<br>

Personally, I don't think anyone should have to bring "grillables" for<br>
everyone.  It would work much better if each of us brought our own<br>
hotdogs/hamburgers or "grillable" of choice and the buns, then a dish<br>
to share or other shareable items. <br>

For 1, 2 or even 3 people to have to bring the meat for all, plus what<br>

excessive. <br>
