                    <div class="plaintext-content">Zounds!  It sounds like a rash of letterboxes have gone missing <br/>
lately.  The Newsweek article?   The juju leftover from tropical <br/>
hurricanes?  Leftover juju from political conventions?  Spoiled <br/>
leftovers?   <br/>
<br/>
I had a revelation the other day, which I shared with Inbal <br/>
kashtan/Alien Explorers planter which may be worth passing along. <br/>
The <br/>
other day, I watched as a squirel began to chew the ropes on my <br/>
hammock.  It turns out this is a brand new hammock, recently<br/>
replacing <br/>
another rope hammock that some devious critter had chewed through.  <br/>
<br/>
As it turns out that hammock is a favorite after school snack hangout.<br/>
...my son and I eat out there and he climbs around with his greasy, <br/>
salty hands.  At night the animals must just love coming by for a <br/>
taste.  I know from being woken up in the middle of the night while <br/>
backpacking by critters who come to chew on backpack straps (they go <br/>
after the salt in perspiration) that they are pretty deperate for <br/>
human comestibles. So we have placed a ban on eating in the hammock.  <br/>
<br/>
I realize at least two of my missing three boxes could have been drug <br/>
off by animals.  If a letterboxer had just eaten and had traces of <br/>
food on their hands the smell alone on the tupperware could attrack <br/>
curious and hungry critters. <br/>
<br/>
SO I guess the take home message is: weigh down your box somehow and <br/>
wash your hands after eating if you are going to be handling a box. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I think the insensitive Homo sapiens is still are bigest <br/>
threat, but not sure how to solve that one.  Round the squares #2 was <br/>
probably taken by late night drinking adjudicated youth...so maybe <br/>
chekout your spot by day and night to see who likes to hang out<br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
happy letterboxing, <br/>
