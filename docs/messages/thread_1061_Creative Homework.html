I do want to allow for some social time after the workshop. After all,<br>
if people end up creatively stimulated, we'll all be bouncing ideas<br>
off each other.<br>
<br>
There will be a small amount of pre-work that people should do before<br>
coming to the workshop. I'll publish a web page with details, but<br>
basically, you arrive with certain ideas that we'll work with. For<br>
now, here are 2 things you can begin thinking about. If you have a<br>
small notebook or journal that's easy to carry around, make it into<br>
your 'idea book', and write down your thoughts about these 2 questions:<br>
<br>
1. What is YOUR definition of what a letterbox is?<br>
2. What attributes can a letterbox have (i.e., size, hiding place,<br>
logbook, etc.). List as many as you can come up with -- then see if<br>
you can come up with some new ones.<br>
<br>
Then, start a list in your idea book of themes and categories that<br>
encompass areas like historical periods, environments, geography,<br>
sacred/special places, art/architectural styles, pastimes, symbols,<br>
things magical/supernatural/mythological, notable people, ethnic<br>
groups, moods, ephemera... and ... and<br>
<br>
You can find items for your list by looking around your home, at your<br>
books, music, movies... and thinking about what catches your eye and<br>
interests you.<br>
<br>
Here's a bit of my list (some of these have inspired boxes or quilts<br>
or...)<br>
<br>
Venice, volcanos, medieval pageant plays, ancient Rome, old maps,<br>
spice trade, Silk Road, voodoo, Atlantis, mazes, Eden, the circus,<br>
totem poles, superstitions, Versailles, the Crusades, Art Deco,<br>
croquet, planting and harvesting cycles, fireworks, eclipses,<br>
fountains, Greek mythology, masks, illuminated manuscripts... <br>
<br>
Once you start compiling this list, you'll be amazed at how handy<br>
it'll be -- for a variety of things, not just boxes. And, you can<br>
begin combining themes to come up with real novel concepts. Guess<br>
what? This is what Cirque du Soleil does -- they blended gypsy music<br>
with Icarus and the rain forest to create 'Varekai'.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Lisa, dandelion wine uses just the petals of the flower, not<br>
the greens. When you cook a lot of dandelion petals to make wine, the<br>
smell is incredible. The finished wine doesn't taste like anything<br>
you'd be familiar with. Traditionally, you pick the flowers and make<br>
the wine in the spring, and drink the wine around Christmas. And yes,<br>
my dandelion wine making friends did a performance of Ray Bradbury's<br>
story in the stage version...<br>
