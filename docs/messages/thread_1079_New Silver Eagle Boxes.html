and left two new letterboxes for all of us to enjoy.  We have had the <br/>
pleasure of hunting and stamping into boxes by Silver Eagle across the <br/>
south, in New Jersey, and in Southern California.  His clues are <br/>
always interesting and informative.  We welcome his presence among us, <br/>
no matter how brief, and look forward to searching for his new boxes.<br/>
