Paul, I think you'd really like this one, too:<br/>

your Not-So-Square name. clever!<br/>

I will have artwork at the Bolinas Museum<br/>
http://www.bolinasmuseum.org/genadd.html<br/>
in their annual Mini Show, which opens Nov. 17.<br/>
I think I will be there to volunteer at the major donor<br/>
preview Friday Night (a donation of $100 gets you in),<br/>
but haven't made my plans yet, and don't know if I<br/>
will be at the opening Saturday. Even if I'm not there,<br/>
it's a great little day trip and wonderful little art.<br/>
Lisa, you would also enjoy my friend Keith Hansen, an amazing<br/>
ornithologist and bird artist who has a gallery next door<br/>
to the museum. Wow, just found his website!<br/>

I miss boxing, and all you great friends! Kel<br/>

I started choreographing a fast Cape Breton folk violin piece by<br/>
Natalie MacMaster called "Volcanic Jig", but ran into major scheduling<br/>
problems working with 8 dancers -- especially now that we're getting<br/>
into the holidays.<br/>
So after re-thinking, I'm doing a Mozart adagio -- slow &amp; graceful --<br/>
that I'm calling "Mozart For Four", which will use just 4 dancers, or<br/>
a half-square. The minuet &amp; French Court dances are part of square<br/>
dancings family tree -- along with Morris dancing, the quadrille, and<br/>
Scottish &amp; English country dancing.<br/>
