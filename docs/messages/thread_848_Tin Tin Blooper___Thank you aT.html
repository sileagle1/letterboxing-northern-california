needed to do some investigating because too many people were getting <br/>
confused on Box 2.  As it turns out, the concave/convex thing was <br/>
getting unnecessarily hard due to my ommission of one word.  If you <br/>
are the type who prints out clues when they are first posted (Lea?  da <br/>
Kool Kats?) then you will want to recycle those and reprint the new <br/>
ones before you go.  I also added a few more hints.  <br/>
<br/>
My apologies to any and all who got confused and hopefully everyone <br/>
will be successful.  It is interesting to note that there is an <br/>
exhibit in the Exploratorium exactly about the imprecision of <br/>
languange descriptions...actually not the language's fault, but our <br/>
imprecise use of language to describe things.  Two people sit across <br/>
from each other at a table with a vertical divider between them.  Each <br/>
person has the identical tray and a series of colored shapes to <br/>
arrange within the tray. One person takes a turn designing an <br/>
arrangement and then tries to describe it to the other person who then <br/>
tries to recreate it.  Once finished you can check how well you did.  <br/>
IT is harder than it sounds, and basically is the letterbox clue <br/>
writing experience in a nutshell. But then there are those who <br/>
deliberately try to obfuscate....and I like that too, infinitely more <br/>
challenging  and memorable. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in my mind I was thinking Alcatraz Island, and only mentioned <br/>
Alcatraz in the clue, which most people would construe as Alcatraz <br/>
prison and then the die is cast for confusion.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy ending: aT found all the boxes.  <br/>
