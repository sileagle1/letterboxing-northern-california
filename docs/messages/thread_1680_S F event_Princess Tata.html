After crunching all the numbers (I know, some of you don't do it for the numbers. . . ) it turns out Princess Tata was our 200th exchange! I think this portends fame of some sort for her in the letterboxing community.<br>

My assessment: Fun, crazy, hectic, but good! I came home with 39 new stamps in my book--not bad for a day's haul. I should have had 3 more, but apparently Spongeboboh stamped someone else's book instead of mine...still not sure how that happened.<br>

So, how was it??? I see there were many boxes planted for the event - they sound cool! As a consolation to missing the gathering, at least I got to meet Chewbacca at the party I was at in Marin. No really, I met the guy who works for Lucas Films and wears the costume whenever needed (movie premieres, on the Colbert report, etc), although he has never appeared in the films.-- Princess Lea <br>

You are so sweet.  Kiersta doesn't need any gifts/surprises, but I know she'll be thrilled with anything.  Between you and Wendy, she's going to clean up!<br>
 <br>
Princess Tata only has 40 finds, or so, not 200.  We're averaging 10 finds per year for her age (we won't go into averages per year for my age).<br>
Take care,<br>

OK, I'm a dork.  I need to read my messages in order and not in some backwards random fashion.  No one said Princess Tata had 200 exchanges/finds.  She was the 200th exchange--that's cool!<br>
 <br>
Thanks for making her noteworthy!<br>
