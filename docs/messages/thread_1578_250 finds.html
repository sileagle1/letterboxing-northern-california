Got it on a new series in San Rafael placed by a geocacher. First<br/>
stamp was an eraser in the shape a parrot, the 2nd was on a cork, the<br/>
third on a superball cut in half. Very interesting. Someone had found<br/>
#1 but not #2 and the 3rd was signed into by cachers-but no junk was<br/>
in the container..<br/>
Also got a really nice one in a new box this morning called 'Pirates<br/>
Lute' out in Tamales-Great Stamp. Took Lillie Bug and Flower Girl and<br/>
had a nice drive in the country and walk in the cemetary.<br/>
