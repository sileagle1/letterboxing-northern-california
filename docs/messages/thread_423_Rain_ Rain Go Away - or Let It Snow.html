I am feeling well enough to want to resume searching for <br>
letterboxes, but the rain has put a damper on that activity.  I <br>
console myself with carving new stamps.  :-)<br>
<br>
Grumpy and I are about to begin another cross-country road trip with <br>
lots of letterboxing included.  We'll go south then across I-10 to <br>
Florida.  Eventually we will go North to New Hampshire, where we <br>
plan to tarry awhile and search for letterboxes in the snow.  I <br>
cannot believe we lived there for over 11 years and never knew about <br>
letterboxing!  So many boxes unfound...<br>
<br>
We will keep in touch with all your activities, finds, plants, etc. <br>
on this message board.  We'll look forward to the late March or <br>
early April gathering.  Happy Letterboxing New Year!<br>

Just in case you hadn't heard of it yet, I'll point it out now. <br>
There's a 'Trip Planner' on Atlas Quest that will allow you to search<br>
for letterboxes along major routes in the United States (and New<br>
Zealand, but that's a bit far off track) including I-10.  Type in the<br>
route you want to search, what sort of letterboxes you want to find<br>
(probably drive-bys), and how far off of the route you're willing to<br>
drive for the box and it'll list all the boxes along the route from<br>
California to Florida.  Pretty cool stuff!  =)<br>

Thanks, Ryan, for the tip.  Actually, I do know about Atlas Quest's <br>
trip-planner.  But because I am a lover of detail, I enjoy the map <br>
and look-up method.  Grumpy and I plot our route then I take map in <br>
hand and the LBNA map, checking each state according to the counties <br>
we will traverse.  As I find boxes we think we might seek, I print <br>
them out and put them in order in state folders.  Of course, as new <br>
clues appear I print them as well, or hand-copy when we are on the <br>
road and away from the printer.  For me, anticipation and <br>
preparation are part of the fun of letterboxing!<br>
<br>
Happy Hunting in 2005<br>
