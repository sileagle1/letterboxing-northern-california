letterbox is not, in fact, missing.  Marmalade from Oregon found it on<br/>
what seems to be her Lisa-and-Robb tour of the East Bay.<br/>
<br/>
She and her group scooped up:<br/>
<br/>
Good Fortune<br/>
Scharffen Berger<br/>
Fish Ranch<br/>
Recycle! Re-Use! Renew!<br/>
and Robb's Canadian Bandstand<br/>
<br/>
***********************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to let everyone know that the Berkeley Repertory<br/>
Theatre's new season is about to start, which means that I'll be<br/>
retiring last season's shows, and premiering a new series of shows. <br/>
First up (and not created yet) Mother Courage.<br/>

Cheers!<br/>
