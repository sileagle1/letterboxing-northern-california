Paul in SF rides again! And this time, he's riding on the perfect <br/>
vehicle for letterboxing: a 150 cc scooter that zooms up and down SF <br/>
hills like a breeze and can park on a sliver of asphalt. My scooter <br/>
is truly Lb-enabling.<br/>
<br/>
I just got back from Central NY, where I organized &amp; held a small <br/>
gathering to celebrate the 1st year anniversary of LbCNY, which I <br/>
founded. Still an intimate group, we've grown to 51 members. <br/>
Lisascenic (also of LbNCA) shares the bi-coastal letterbox areas <br/>
with me - she was at the LbCNY gathering. While in NY for one week, <br/>
I planted 8 new boxes, and replaced 3 that were missing. I also <br/>
found about 15 boxes. Central NY is quickly becoming a mecca for <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Now my attention is back home, the energy continues, and the first <br/>
of several new boxes has been hidden. It's called 'Ortus Depths' and <br/>
is a strange play on the name of a beautiful place.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp is one of my large hinged, folding ones, and I think <br/>
you'll like having it in your collection.<br/>
<br/>
I have another, and quite different box, almost ready right <br/>
behind 'Ortus'. It's called 'Magritte's Therapeutist' -- and it's <br/>
part of the surreal side of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! I'M BACK!<br/>
Paul in SF<br/>
