SP <br/>
<br/>
I went to a birthday party on Saturday &amp; in the process of looking the<br/>
map up online, I noticed there was a Sugarloaf Park just at the edge of<br/>
the map.  Could this be the fabled SRSP I'd read so much about?  Maybe I<br/>
could sneak away from the party early &amp; pick up a few boxes.  I<br/>
frantically searched lb.org &amp; the State Park website &amp; found it was not<br/>
the same one.  I had found Sugarloaf Open Space Recreation Area near<br/>
Walnut Creek &amp; not SRSP.  While I had the crazy idea of planting a box<br/>
there in honor of my friend's birthday, housework got the better of me.<br/>
But, after doing a little research, the Open Areas around Walnut Creek<br/>
look like excellent places for boxes for anyone in the area.<br/>
<br/>
&amp; while we're on the subject of State Parks, is there the same<br/>
prohibition on planting boxes in them as there is in National Parks?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Yes and no - it depends on  the rangers in the particular state park.  <br/>
 From what I hear, the Sonoma county rangers are fairly cool about it, <br/>
as long as you ask permission first (though I'm not sure what you'd do <br/>
if they said no - hide it anyway on the sly?)  I have never asked <br/>
permission, and I have had my 3 at Samuel P. Taylor Park (in Marin) <br/>
pulled by rangers.  However, I did not get any letters of persecution <br/>
like Amanda has up in Washington.<br/>

P.S. to Mim - CONGRATULATIONS!  Next time you see me, make sure to get <br/>
he bonus box for finding all 3 in the series - I carry it as a <br/>
traveler.<br/>
