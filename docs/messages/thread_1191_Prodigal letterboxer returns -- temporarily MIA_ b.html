                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I vanished for a while, and let my e-mail and letterboxing get <br/>
all dusty and cobwebby... but other things in my life needed and got <br/>
attention, and that is a very good thing.<br/>
<br/>
One of those good things was changing to a new and improved Ultimate <br/>
Letterboxing Vehicle (ULV). I now own a much sturdier, and more <br/>
powerful Honda Big Ruckus scooter with a 250cc engine. With a low <br/>
center of gravity, it's safer and smoother to ride. Best of all, I <br/>
can now cross bridges and go on Rtes. 101 and 280, so I can get to <br/>
exotic places such as Santa Rosa, or (gasp!) Oakland!<br/>
<br/>
I also started helping to plan a gathering (lisascenic take note!) <br/>
for LbNY in July. That's when my annual family pilgrimage occurs, so <br/>
we'll probably gather in Trenton, NY about 20 miles north of my <br/>
family's village. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, 2 years after I planted 5 lonely initial boxes in central NY, <br/>
the area is now vying for the title of Letterboxer's Paradise (move <br/>
over, Vermont!) It's Boxes Gone Wild!<br/>
<br/>
Did someone mention a gathering for LbNCA soon? I haven't poured <br/>
through the past posts, but I did see a reference to the fact that <br/>
Golden Gate Park is NOT under the jurisdiction of the National Park <br/>
Service -- it's an SF managed park, and open to boxes. If the <br/>
gathering isn't during 7/20 - 7/30 (NY trip), count me in.<br/>
<br/>
Well, now that you know I'm alive, I suppose I'd better do some <br/>
letterboxing, esp. with my new ULV (Ultimate Letterboxing Vehicle, <br/>
much more fuel efficient than SUVs)!<br/>
