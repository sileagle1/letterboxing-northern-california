As there is an art exhibit reception on that Saturday, the 28th at <br/>

Here is a link to the park map, the center is just south of the Tidal<br/>

Also, in case you might be interested in the art exhibit, here's some<br/>
info on it:<br/>
<br/>
Celebrate 'Katrina's Children' Opening Event<br/>
Saturday, January 28, 2:30 to 4 p.m. <br/>
<br/>
Co-founded by former US Poet Laureate Robert Hass and East Bay writer<br/>
Pamela Michael, River of Words has assembled an unparalleled collection<br/>
of Gulf Coast children's art and poetry. Entitled 'Katrina's Children,'<br/>
the exhibit will be on display in the Center's Gathering Room. This<br/>
display will also feature interpretive panels that consider the<br/>
connections between loss of wetlands and storm destruction, so<br/>
tragically illustrated in New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf Coast in<br/>
2005.<br/>
<br/>
Join us for an inspiring day of art, poetry, science, and song at Crissy<br/>
Field Center. In addition to viewing the 'Katrina's Children' exhibit,<br/>
get a little messy with hands-on activities that show how wetlands<br/>
protect us, and learn how you can get involved in wetlands restoration.<br/>
You';ll also be able to listen to young poets read their work and enjoy<br/>
live Cajun music, all while digging into the celebration cake that will<br/>
be on hand to mark River of Words 10th anniversary. <br/>
