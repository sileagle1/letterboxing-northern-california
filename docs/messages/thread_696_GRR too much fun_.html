                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone for making such a wonderful day in Old Sac on <br>
Saturday!  My only regret is that I was afflicted by a terrible case <br>
of zombie-boxitis (must...get....the....next....lettterbox...)and <br>
was feeling very overwhelmed by the wealth of choices...schmooze <br>
with the glitterati?  Meet folk I have not yet talked to?  Start <br>
looking for boxes?  Go off in search of the perfect iced coffee?  (I <br>
never found it.)  <br>
<br>
I was dazed and confused for at least the first two hours and only <br>
when I actually started boxing by committee with WW, Flower and AT <br>
did things start to gel.  And then the slackboxing after lunch; the <br>
totally bezerker, lets-get-it-done expeditious boxing in the <br>
afternoon; then simple carbohydrate splurging (thanks Sally!), the <br>
final attempts to get a few more boxes (nabbed that Rattlesnake Dick <br>
and Up, up and away too...I really enjoyed meeting the "King" Anwar <br>
Shah Kahn...nice guy.)  And a quick stop on the way home to try to <br>
bag Every flavor BEans again...still could not find.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I had a great time and wholeheartedly second Ryan's vote for <br>
a visit to the Train Museum on your next visit to Old Sac...it is <br>
incredible as is its sister museum in Sierra Foothills.  <br>
<br>
I think it would be fun to have a gathering this summer and not have <br>
it centered around boxing... just hanging out, talking, looking at <br>
each others logbooks, swapping tall tales of the trail and actually <br>
have time for a carving demo where I would not be too distracted to <br>
actually watch and learn something.  I would even go so far to offer <br>
my home for such an event if there is interest.  (Santa Rosa) But it <br>
would have to be in August because our house is partially ripped up <br>
at the moment and wont be put back together until then.  <br>
