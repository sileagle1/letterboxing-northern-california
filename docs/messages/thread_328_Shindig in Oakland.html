I think it is a great idea!  Gets me off the hook for cleaning my <br/>
house!  I would be happy to go!  But not Thanksgiving weekend, that <br/>
is when I had hoped to go up the COast to go find the St. Patrick <br/>
Series.  I suspect the heat will be turned off during winter break, <br/>
but we could jumping jacks and wear our coats.  I can picture us all <br/>
wearing fingerless gloves and carving in the frosty air.  <br/>
