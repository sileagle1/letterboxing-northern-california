Yes, to both those questions.  I've abused those ideas quite<br/>
thoroughly with an African Safari series you can see at<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/OR/AfricanSafari/<br/>
<br/>
Each box is on a different trail and it would likely take most people<br/>
a week to nab ALL of the boxes in the series.  To get them all without<br/>
any driving would likely take a month!  I started planting them about<br/>
three years ago, and I'm still not done adding to the series!  I<br/>
already have two stamps carved and ready to be placed for the series.<br/>

Stephanie,<br/>
I think the answers to your questions can be summed up by saying <br/>
that your letterboxes are yours to set up and do with as you wish.<br/>
The clues, where to post, or not, the stamp, box location and <br/>
whether to put them in a series or individually is strickly your <br/>
call. The one thing I would caution you about is that if you place <br/>
the clues for one or more boxes in one other box it is a real pain <br/>
in the rear when that clue holding box goes missing.<br/>
 Some series letterboxes with their own clue sheets are Sierra <br/>
Sally's Mission Series, and we have several Outlaw series <br/>
letterboxes that Gwen &amp; I, Sierra Sally, and Buzzard have put out.<br/>

Ah, you forget, There Are No Rules!  One of the more enjoyable <br/>
series we have found involves letterboxes placed at various cultural <br/>
locations in the Central Valley.  Lots of driving from place to <br/>
place, but a great introduction to the cultural influences within <br/>
the communities.<br/>
