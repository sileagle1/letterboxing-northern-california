the 'zine itself, sorta like getting the program signed by the players at<br>

I know that it was kinda decided that a clues wrangler wasn't really<br>

shindig, and I'd love to offer to make a clues packet for the event<br>
and make copies. <br>

hand made, old skool, hard core ZINE!! What is a zine you ask? short<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm all for creativity and I love to see the way different people are <br>
inspired.  I think it's a great idea.  I also like the idea of some <br>
blank pages for stamps - or a special spot for the event stamp.You could <br>
even carve a stamp for the zine itself. :D  You almost make me want to <br>
do an artistamp for the event, too.. :)<br>
<br>
Reminder - if you haven't RSVPd via AQ or with Kathy for potluck <br>
headcount, and you're planning on attending, please do!<br>
<br>
Until Saturday,<br>
