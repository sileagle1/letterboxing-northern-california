I finally uploaded a picture of the stamp I was babbling on about <br/>
the other night.  I still need to adjust a few things -- the back leg <br/>
of the table needs some love.  And please ignore the perspective <br/>
weirdness.  Nothing I can do about that now!<br/>

What you're seeing in the photo is one of the owners of Adelphi <br/>
Paper Hanging getting ready to set down and print a carved <br/>
wood block .  After he sets the block down, he'll use that long <br/>
horizontal bar to press the block on to the roll of paper.  You can <br/>
see the printed paper hanging off the end of the table in the front <br/>
of the image.<br/>
<br/>
The blocks are based on historic wallpapers.  They draw out the <br/>
different colors onto acetate and then have the wooden blocks <br/>
carved by lasers.  The fine finishing on the carving is done by <br/>
hand, but since the blocks are extrememely hard fruitwood, the <br/>
laser is a great time-saver.<br/>
<br/>
If you click this link, you'll see the particular paper from my stamp <br/>
in the studio at Adlephi.<br/>

I was amused to see that Princess Lea found my aquatic birds <br/>
less than 24 hours after I planted them.  Lea, you're quite the <br/>
go-getter!<br/>
