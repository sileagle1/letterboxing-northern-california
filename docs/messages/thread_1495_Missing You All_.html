obligations that day.  We wish you all extreme stealth and fun.  <br>
Confound those Muggles, find the hidden treasures (boxes and eggs!), <br>
and have a blast.<br>
<br>
We just returned from 2 weeks of hiking and letterboxing in Arizona <br>
and San Diego.  We were on a trail returning to our car when a <br>
couple passed us.  The woman turned to us and said "Are You <br>
Letterboxers?"  Now I swear that we were doing NOTHING suspicious, <br>
just walking and talking.  I, of course, responded, "Which way is <br>
North."  Turned out the other couple were WANDA AND PETE from Rhode <br>
Island, in San Diego for the gathering last weekend.  I have never <br>
seen anyone move faster on a trail than Wanda!<br>
<br>
Hope to see some of you on a trail one of these days.  If you ask, I <br>
probably will know "which way is north."<br>

Hope to see you on the trails soon.<br>
