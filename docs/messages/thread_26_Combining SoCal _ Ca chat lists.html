I've kind of been avoiding this issue because I want to do what's <br/>
right, but I'm not sure!  Looking at the posts on the two boards <br/>
since I started this one, the Socal board seems to be prospering in <br/>
it's own right with it's own personality, but nobody from Northern <br/>
California seems to have embraced it.  So I'm more inclined to turn <br/>
my board into a Northern California board.<br/>
<br/>
But then, I like the idea of one, single California board myself.  <br/>
That's just my preference, though, and I want to be careful not to <br/>
force my opinions on how things should be done on everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a couple of polls letting you guys decide should be made.  <br/>
Hmmm....  Should the talk lists be combined into one talk list or <br/>
separated into two distinct Northern California and Southern <br/>
California talk lists.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I think I'll do that.  Be expecting a poll soon!  (Within a few <br/>
minutes, at least.)  I'll leave it open for a couple of weeks to give <br/>
everyone time to vote.  A similar poll on the SoCal talk list might <br/>
be a good idea too since not everyone is on both boards and the mood <br/>
could be very different on each of the boards.<br/>
