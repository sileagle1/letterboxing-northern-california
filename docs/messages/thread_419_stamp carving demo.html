<br/>
My apologies for getting carried away boxing with Mim<br/>
and showing up so late! It was a wonderful<br/>
afternoon--well worth the roundtrip. I really enjoyed<br/>
meeting everyone, exchanging stamps &amp; stories, putting<br/>
faces and real names to trail names. Everyone made<br/>
appreciated contributions to the afternoon, my<br/>
favorite being the great space that Blackbird calls<br/>
her work home. Oh, to be a student in her class. And<br/>
we did miss those who couldn't be there. Grinchy folk<br/>
and blue sages and others.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who saw my Lion Turtle art, it is now<br/>
a stamp! and will travel to New Zealand next week. As<br/>
the personal stamp of friends who are not (yet)<br/>
letterboxers. I am so envious.<br/>
<br/>
I sure look forward to April, and our gathering. My<br/>
only question for now and later is, what's it gonna<br/>
take to get you yahoos up to Tahoe?!?!!!  :-)<br/>
