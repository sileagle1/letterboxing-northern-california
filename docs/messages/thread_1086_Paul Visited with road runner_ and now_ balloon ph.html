Check the photos section. The heart-and-swirls-sculptures are <br>
approx. 8 feet tall and 3 feet across, as is the swirly tree with <br>
purple flowers. The large single flower is about 4 feet across.<br>
<br>
Popeye is about 3 feet tall.<br>
<br>
The holiday scene with Santa, and the cornucopia were displayed in <br>
one of the lobbies at work (Schwab). On rare occasions, I do large <br>
balloon sculptures for dance clubs.<br>
<br>
I once made a 12 foot tall tree in my living room -- it had a <br>
detachable monkey in the branches that became a kid's party hat, <br>
hugging his head. It was so immense, it had to be short-lived. I had <br>
to pop it in order to have my living room back.<br>
<br>
On a different note, it was great seeing Robb take some of his first <br>
steps again, and being there to assist. What a guy! The power of the <br>
mind... <br>
<br>
Also,I just taught an all morning (4 hour) version of my Creative <br>
Thinking workshop at Schwab to 22 people. It went very smoothly, and <br>
it improved, because of the extra practice I got at our workshop.<br>
<br>
Amanda from Seattle said she'd be interested in another session, and <br>
I think Mimulus is interested, too. If there are at least 5 people, <br>
I'll schedule another one. If someone want to organize, I'll <br>
facilitate.<br>

Took a look at your balloon sculptures and we  were truly amazed by them! <br>
Works of art!! That Cornucopia is something we'd have  never imagined and the <br>
'drippy' dangling hearts are beautiful! <br>
 <br>
You never cease to amaze us, Paul! How, in an  expanse of years that closely <br>
resembles our own lifetime, have you managed to  become so proficient at SO <br>
many different and diverse subjects!! You even QUILT  for goodness sakes!! Our <br>
favorite part of your photo album though, was what we  assume is the title of <br>
your business. What a hoot!!<br>
 <br>
You are an inspiration, to say the least and a  darned good guy to boot!  <br>

I'm into so many different things that I can easily overwhelm people <br>
with my interests. <br>
<br>
I'll let you in on a secret... <br>
<br>
You can learn LOTS of diverse things and pick them up quickly once <br>
you watch for similarities between new things and what you already <br>
know how to do. Sometimes there isn't much overlap, but even some <br>
shared concepts help you get started.<br>
<br>
The more skills you add, the more relationships between things start <br>
to appear. Balloon sculpting shares some concepts with 1) <br>
basketmaking and 2) origami -- folding and weaving are in common  <br>
(with twisting added for balloons). Quilting and stained glass are <br>
related, too (pieces need to fit together to make a whole image).<br>
<br>
This was one piece of the discussion from the Creative Thinking <br>
workshop: filling your 'well' with experiences & ideas to draw from.<br>
<br>
The name of my balloon business, Latex & Pumps, I thought, was a fun <br>
play on words. I only use it for adult bookings. It usually goes <br>
over peoples' heads -- for a moment, at least.<br>
