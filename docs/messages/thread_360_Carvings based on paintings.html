Hi Paul, <br/>
<br/>
I have only carved one stamp based on a painting.  It is rock repose <br/>
and it is based on an oil painting by Franz von Stuck, entitled <br/>
Sisyphus painted in 1920.  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily for me, the painting is mostly greys, white, black and red. <br/>
http://www.illusionsgallery.com/Sisyphus.html And it really lent <br/>
itself to be translated into a  carved stamp.  I had recently looked <br/>
at a book of 18th century wood carvings and was trying to use <br/>
techniques that covey a sense of texture...or rather using texture <br/>
rather than color to design/organize space.   <br/>
<br/>
I had been inspired by Princess Lea's Museum of Modern Art Stamp #1 <br/>
which is based on another more famous oil painting from the same era <br/>
as von Stuck's.  And it has similar qualities to it....strong linear <br/>
character, not alot of fine detail which makes for easy carving.  I <br/>
do not feel up to tackling a CAravagio yet.....<br/>
