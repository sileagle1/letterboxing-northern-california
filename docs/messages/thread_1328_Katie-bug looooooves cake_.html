THANK YOU to everyone involved in the BASS yesterday.  I know others <br/>
have said it more eloquently, but I can't say enough how much Katie <br/>
and I totally enjoyed yesterday's shindig!  This group is so amazingly <br/>
talented and CREATIVE, that I would be overwhelmed and intimidated if <br/>
it weren't for the fact that you are also such NICE people!<br/>
<br/>
A special Happy Birthday to Crow-Girl of dem xx men - and congrats to <br/>
Hunter for creating such a special cake.  Katie LOOOOVED that cake!  <br/>
When we got home, what is the first thing she said to Mom?  Was it <br/>
that we saw beautiful carvings, solved masterful clues, embarked upon <br/>
exciting adventures, or met fascinating people?  No.  She told Mom she <br/>
had a perfect day because she got to have TWO pieces of cake!  And <br/>
Soda!  I hurriedly explained to Mom that she ALSO had a healthful, <br/>
balanced meal of black hot-dogs and potato chips, but I'm not sure <br/>
that really helped...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was great putting faces to all those stamps and posts... <br/>
you are a terrific bunch of addicts, and I am happy to be a part of <br/>
this whole mess!  Thanks to everyone involved!<br/>
