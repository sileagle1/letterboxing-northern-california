their blog, so if you want to submit a patch design, please e-mail it to<br/>
mjpepe1@comcast.net<br/>
<br/>
Please make sure that it is in jpg. format!<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm going to set the deadline for entries as February 12th.  <br/>
If we get close to that and haven't had many entries or people are <br/>
asking for more time, I'll extend it, but it would be nice to move <br/>
things along quickly so that maybe the patches will be ready in time <br/>
for the San Diego gathering.<br/>

of them from the same person).  I'm considering extending the <br/>
deadline, but I don't want to do that if it won't make any <br/>
difference anyway.  If there's anyone who would submit a design if I <br/>
extended the deadline by a week or so, please e-mail me and let me <br/>
know by the end of tomorrow.  If I don't hear from anyone, we'll go <br/>
ahead and vote on the three designs that we do have.<br/>
