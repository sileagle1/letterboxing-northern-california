&gt;  Great to see that our own amazingly motivated Princess Lea has already<br/>
&gt;  found the Cicada letterbox, even if NOBODY has attempted the San<br/>
&gt;  Leandro letterbox. (hint....hint....)<br/>

Well what needs to be done is to light a fire under a certain cat who <br/>
prefers to nap's butt and maybe we could get down there.  Seems like <br/>
she is being more contrary than usual about boxing this summer.  I <br/>
believe I have translated the Latin sufficiently to get me within in <br/>
striking distance (I particularly like the toxicodendrum clue - very <br/>
clever).  However, I think I am going to be in the Gilroy area tomorrow <br/>
afternoon, solo - Aahz (or anyone else who has been there lately), are <br/>
all the Gilroy boxes alive and well?<br/>
