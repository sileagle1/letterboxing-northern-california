                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all.  I'm off to pull our Animal Farm series to recarve (on better<br/>
material), replant (in a different park), and reclue.  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn't getting the traffic we wanted it to, and that's partly due<br/>
to the pain-in-the-butt clues (we thought we were being<br/>
clever--sorry), and the length of the walk.  We've recently discovered<br/>
a wonderful park that needs some action, and it's a perfect fit for<br/>
Animal Farm.  So, if you were headed out the door to get this one,<br/>
wait!  It'll be back up and running certainly by the April gathering,<br/>
and it'll be on the same side of town as Alum Rock Park, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
