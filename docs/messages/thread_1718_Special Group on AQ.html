                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I created a group on Atlas Quest called LbNCA which I plan to use to distribute clues to the members of this list.  In the attributes section of AQ clues you click a box so that the clue will be accessible only to those who are members of the designated group.  While I know that not everyone is a fan of restricted clues, I consider it just one more way to add spice to the game.<br/>
<br/>
I am also hoping to reinvigorate this list - it seems like many of the posts that used to go through here are now on the California board of AQ.  That's not a problem per se, but California is a big place, and I like that this list is a bit more focused.<br/>
<br/>
This week I plan to work on the boxes I will be planting with the LbNCA only clues.  The theme is Shakespeare in the Park and they will be in Tilden Park.  Another reason for the layer of secrecy afforded by the restriction is to keep the Tilden rangers away from the clues.  I am inviting everyone to plant other Shakespeare boxes in the park too and make it a group project.  Just remember to put the LbNCA group restriction on it.<br/>
<br/>
With Denise's recent challenge to us in the Bay Area to plant 10 boxes each before her return from Alaska, I am hoping that some of you will consider adding to this endeavor. <br/>

P.S.  I will send invitations to the AQ group out - if I miss you and you want to join, please just send me a quick email<br/>
