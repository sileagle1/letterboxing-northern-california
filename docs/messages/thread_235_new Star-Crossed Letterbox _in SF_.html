                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was at a certain LbNCa gathering recently, when a certain fellow (a <br/>
frog with boots comes to mind) from one of those uncertain blueberry-<br/>
growing states up north, made a vague and uncertain remark about the <br/>
clues I write. I believe it was something to the effect that they <br/>
were a bit verbose or maybe it was just that the word count was <br/>
rather high.<br/>
<br/>
So let me be succinct and make myself perfectly clear: I live alone <br/>
and have two cats, (Reno and Vegas), that are sick and tired of <br/>
listening to me ramble on. So someone has to suffer...<br/>
<br/>
Getting to the point, let me not mince words, and I hereby announce <br/>
that I have planted a box and written clues for it with an extremely <br/>
low word count, simply in order to quiet the frogs and reduce my word <br/>
count average. <br/>
<br/>
BUT, this box is a thing of beauty and well worth pursuing... It is <br/>

I personally enjoy your clues, being a low word count kind of gal <br/>

<br/>
Actually, what I said was that someone had told me you planted a box <br/>
in Massachusetts that had easy, straight-forward clues, and I didn't <br/>
believe that nonsense for a minute.  Paul from SF making easy, <br/>
straight-forward clues?!  Yeah, when pigs fly, perhaps!<br/>
<br/>
So I looked for myself, and while the directions were in fact easy, <br/>
it was still had that signature Paul of SF mark by being uniquely <br/>
different with very professional looking clues, this one having <br/>
excelled at rambling.  (Not that that's a bad thing, mind you.  I <br/>
enjoy reading a good novel as much as the next person when I'm <br/>
letterboxing!)<br/>
<br/>
So what does Paul do?  He plants yet another box in his distinctive <br/>
signature style.  Keep it up!  I'd be disappointed if you ever stop <br/>
doing that.  ;o)<br/>

Paul, Perhaps you are confusing the Boxhopper (Frog stamp) with the<br/>
turtle. Boxhopper is the one who loves your balloons, and by the way<br/>
played with them for the three hours it took to drive home.<br/>

Thanks Paul,<br/>
<br/>
Well he did have fun with them.<br/>
