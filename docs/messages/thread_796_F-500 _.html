                    <div class="plaintext-content">In an attempt to go from F447 to F-500 in 8 days, Old Blue and I <br>
decided Portland, Oregon was the place to go for our vacation this <br>
year. With over 100 boxes listed in the city alone, we thought we'd <br>
have a good shot. We hiked about 30 miles in all, we figure, one day <br>
in pouring rain--BUT we were able to get some much sought after <br>
boxes. <br>
<br>
Lucky for us, as a bonus to our trip, there happened to be a <br>
gathering in the area (Silver Falls) and we added 32 exchanges to our <br>
logbooks too! Some wonderful boxers heretofore known only as trail <br>
names on the LbNA list!<br>
<br>
If you ever get a chance to get up to Oregon and Washington, we <br>
highly recommend boxes by Der Mad Stamper, Funhog, Wingnut and <br>
Paisley Orca who are master carvers indeed. Honestly, when we found <br>
Der Mad Stamper's "Spirit of Dartmoor" box (planted in 2001!) and saw <br>
all the fabulous stamps in the logbook, we were hesitant to add <br>
our "measly" signiture stamps to it! I, for one, will be carving a <br>
new sig. stamp soon!<br>
<br>
Anyway, 500 finds in 3 years ain't bad we figure and it's been one <br>
heck of a fun ride. Here's to another 500!<br>

OMG! Old blue was heard saying on our Oregon trip how we'd been neck and neck <br>
with you one time then you went to  the East Coast and surged ahead! Although <br>
I'd seen your plants of late, I hadn't seen your F count so assumed you were <br>
way out front. I'll tell him that, at this moment, we're even and he'll LOVE <br>
it! I suspect it will be fleeting though. . . Mansfield. . .<br>
<br>
We're going to Tuscany in October--our big trip this year. So much for <br>
keeping it even!<br>
