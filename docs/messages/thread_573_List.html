I was wondering about something.  When we go to Letterbox.org and go <br/>
to search, I put in California.  Then I scroll thru a list.  For the <br/>
heck of it I click on different names, however all I get is the <br/>
disclaimer.  Nothing else.  Unless it is a name I know reconize.  Now <br/>
since I don't know many of you how can I find your boxes?  Is there a <br/>
place I am unaware of that has a list of just California "Placers".  <br/>
Or must I just go to the map and look them up by the city ect??? I <br/>
prefer to look up a person and find that way.  Can we set something <br/>
up to create a list of Ca people if there isn't anything out there? <br/>

I don't see this as a real problem as usually you would go to an area and look for letterboxes. I guess that there might be an interest in looking specifically for a particular letterboxer's plants, but most folks aren't as concerned about who's boxes they find as long as they find boxes. I guess with the ever evolving game it could get to looking for letterboxes as you would in your taste for wine. Some like Red, and some prefer White, I'm a Tequila guy that wouldn't know the difference. Ryan might want to consider adding a state function/location to a letterboxer listing on Atlas Quest.<br/>

I'm kind of confused by Michelle's post, actually.  If she wants to<br/>
search for boxes planted by everyone in an area--both LbNA and AQ<br/>
already do that.  Does she want to search for boxes in an area by a<br/>
certain person?  I don't know about LbNA, but you can do that with the<br/>
Advanced Search option on AQ.  A simple list of everybody who's ever<br/>
planted a box in a certain state or region?  Hmmm....  Neither site<br/>
does that, but I suppose I could consider adding such an option.  An<br/>
"Advanced People Search" perhaps?  =)<br/>
<br/>
Since I can run queries on AQ that don't have a web interface, I can<br/>
do run such a query manually.  Here's a list of everyone who has<br/>
planted boxes in California that have listed at least one of them on AQ:<br/>

<br/>
Not really.  People can put whatever they want in their profile.  Some<br/>
people might spell out "California".  Others might abbreviate it to<br/>
"CA".  Others might just list the city of residence such as "Los<br/>
Angeles" or the "SF Bay Area".  There's not really any systematic way<br/>
I can mine the data to list those living in California.<br/>

&gt; My two cents...I thought Michelle was asking what does<br/>

&gt; wondered about myself. Does that box really exist? and<br/>
&gt; we have to do more detective work to find it? or what?<br/>
&gt; It has been one of the unanswered questions for me.<br/>

It was my understanding that Michelle just wanted to be able to find<br/>
clues of the letterboxers who's names she is getting familiar with. <br/>
If the letterboxer mentions on LbNCA that they've placed a new box in<br/>
an area, she is able to get that clue, but she does/did not know how<br/>
to find all of the boxes for that placer.<br/>
<br/>
I told her to go to Lb.org and click on SEARCH for Boxes and then<br/>
scroll down under Pick a Placer until she finds the name of the boxer<br/>
she is looking for such as Princess Lea, Mimulus, Doublesaj and Old<br/>
Blue, etc. and then click on Search Boxes (off to the left) to bring<br/>
up everything for that placer.  This seemed to be what she was looking<br/>
for. <br/>
<br/>
Once a day, I open Lb.org and clck on What's New and run down all of<br/>
the listed boxes until I find one for CA.  If it is for Central to<br/>
Northern CA I print it for future use.  We rarely get to Southern CA.<br/>
I do the same thing on AQ on My Page.  Just to see if any have been<br/>
newly listed that we can get a Find credit for. <br/>

AQ does have an option where you can be notified of new boxes in your<br/>
area.  Do a search like you normally would.  If you don't specify a<br/>
city but do include the state and country, it'll list all boxes in a<br/>
given state.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in the results page, there's a link in the top-right corner that<br/>
allows you to save the search as a "Favorite Search".  With that,<br/>
there's an option to be notified when new boxes are listed that show<br/>
up in your favorite search.<br/>
<br/>
That way, you don't have to troll the What's New? list to see if<br/>
anything new is of interest.  AQ will send you mail when something you<br/>
might be interested in is listed.<br/>
