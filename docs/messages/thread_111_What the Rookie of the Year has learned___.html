                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Princess Lea, for dubbing me with the ROTY designation. You <br/>
are much too kind, and someday soon we'll finally meet to work on <br/>
our collaborative letterbox...<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share a phrase with everyone that I cooked up for myself <br/>
as I write clues. It's sort a mantra, I suppose, for me as a new <br/>
letterboxer:<br/>
<br/>
CLARITY WHEN YOU NEED IT, AMBIGUITY WHEN YOU WANT IT.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the clues and directions I'm creating from this <br/>
standpoint, I make sure that the basics and practical aspects of the <br/>
clues are clear enough to understand by everyone. The puzzle part <br/>
depends on the right amount of ambiguity. Some confusion is a good <br/>
thing, but if the hunter's frustration takes over, you lose as the <br/>
planter. They must be able to sort out the confusing part by using <br/>
common sense, or other elements provided by you or on the scene.<br/>
<br/>
The other item I've learned is that it's a good thing to utilize a <br/>
friend as a tester. Before publishing the clues, recruit a friend to <br/>
try them out. Accompany them as a silent observer. Note where they <br/>
get lost, and if they can sort out the problem and get back on <br/>
track. If they get frustrated, you know you need a bit more clarity.<br/>
Let them give you feedback freely throughout their hunt, but don't <br/>
coach them until absolutely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I find that I review and make adjustments to my clues many, many <br/>
times before publishing them. And if you haven't noticed, I like to <br/>
ramble on with my narratives... <br/>
<br/>
With 2 planted boxes under my belt, and two more on their way, I'm <br/>
having a lot of fun thinking about all the themes and locations that <br/>
would make for interesting boxes. It's also making me re-discover <br/>
San Francisco, and get out of the same old "corridors" and paths <br/>
that have become too familiar. I'm seeing this wonderfully quirky <br/>
city in a new light, and it's refreshing!<br/>

You get our vote for Rookie of the Year too! Your clues are so imaginative, <br/>
it's almost good enough just reading them and imagining finding the box. I've <br/>
already chastised PrincessLea for being first finder for your 2nd box but I <br/>
hear she left the 'reward' for the next finder as she'd already gotten one from <br/>
your Vertigo box--such a good sport!<br/>
<br/>
Very much looking forward to you next boxes. <br/>
