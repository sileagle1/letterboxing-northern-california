                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
  Met up with Team Safari (Mary &amp; Dan) on Friday &amp; had a nice dinner.<br/>
It sounded like Mary (trailname: Mary RI) has been letterboxing for at<br/>
least 4-5 years.  She mentioned they got married 2 years ago, so I'm<br/>
guessing Dan hasn't been boxing as long.  They don't keep track of their<br/>
statistics, but Dan said he tried counting once recently &amp; gave up after<br/>
500 finds.  <br/>
<br/>
They were able to do the Fanny Ann's box with my help.  Unfortunately,<br/>
the 2 final clues have been erased, so I'm going to mark the box as<br/>
inactive for now.  They did leave a hitchhiker in the box, so I'll be<br/>
passing that on soon.  I recognized CelticQuinn's name on the HH's cover<br/>
&amp; they said it was originally a postal letterbox that they got<br/>
permission from CelticQuinn to turn into a HH.  <br/>
<br/>
They headed up to Tahoe on Sunday, so I suggested they send artTrekker<br/>
an email too.<br/>

	Probably too late to catch you before you leave but we won't be<br/>
with you tonite. We had every intention of joining you but Old Blue's<br/>
dad had a medical emergency this afternoon and he went to the Bay Area<br/>
to be with him and his mom. <br/>
<br/>
	Please tell the Lb'ers from Rhode Island we're sorry we can't<br/>
exchange with them as we'd like but that WE will be in THEIR area in<br/>
September! <br/>
<br/>
	Have fun and tell us all about it tomorrow. <br/>

Thanks for the update. So sorry we couldn't be there. Old Blue's still  <br/>
'dealing' with his father's hospitalizations and all the other stuff that goes  <br/>
with that. <br/>
<br/>
Too bad there weren't more Lb'ers to greet these visitors. ArtTrekker is  <br/>
coming home from vacation at the moment but hopefully will be able to get  <br/>
together with them.<br/>
<br/>
Happy 'boxing!<br/>
