We can affirm that!  We have searched extensively twice and it has <br>
remained hidden, even after a confirmation from Lisa that we were <br>
searching the correct area.  Guess we will try again!<br>

Maybe, it's like finding a unicorn or the entrance to Narnia -- you<br>
have to be in the right frame of mind...<br>
