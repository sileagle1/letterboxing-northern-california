Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
Wanted to make a final call for this great event in 2 weeks. <br/>
According to the AtlasQuest posting, it looks like we'll have around <br/>
50 people if everybody shows that has signed up. WHOOHOOO! Meet at <br/>
the picnic tables between I and J Streets at Front Street in Old <br/>
Sacramento at 10:00 am (or whenever you can get there) MANY boxes <br/>
will be planted in the immediate area within easy walking distance <br/>
for all ages.<br/>
<br/>
Bring your own picnic or buy food from the miriad of shops and <br/>
vendors nearby. Don't forget your sunblock and hat! <br/>
<br/>
We've had lots of ideas, all of which sound good to me, I think we'll <br/>
try all of them.  If you want to be in charge of your idea, please <br/>
bring the supplies and implement your suggestion. I'll help in any <br/>
way I can the day of the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
So far the following is the agenda. <br/>
