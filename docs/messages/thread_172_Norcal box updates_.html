<br/>
Clan Jiggs (including Mrs Jiggs for the first time in over a month!) <br/>
took an extended break over the 4th weekend to get in some LBing in <br/>
the NorCal area! My parents have been visiting from Ontario (that's <br/>
Canada, not CA!!) so have introduced them to our hobby! My 74 y/o <br/>
dad really enjoys the walks, my mom is pretty sore in the hips and <br/>
ankles, so was quite content with the "drive-bys"! <br/>
<br/>
We are happy to say that we found all the boxes that we intended to <br/>
get, plus a couple of bonuses!<br/>
<br/>
Fair Oaks - near Sacramento - FF for this recently replanted box! We <br/>
picked it up Jul 4, so had a heck of a time with the louts and boors <br/>
who think everything is an excuse for a beerfest (hmmmm, come to <br/>
think of it, I used to be one !!)<br/>
<br/>
Bear Cub - Donner Summit - alive and well! We had originally tried <br/>
for this one last Nov, but it was under about 8 feet of snow by then!<br/>
<br/>
Picked up the Mr Pecksniff HH as well!<br/>
<br/>
I 80 Series #2 - "Rainbow Bridge" - Donner Lake - we originally <br/>
found this last August, but the view from up there is so incredible, <br/>
we've returned several times since. Left a little "something" <br/>
behind...<br/>
<br/>
Camp Richardson - South Lake Tahoe - Wow, very nice little park <br/>
tucked away amongst the hustle and bustle of the Tahoe scene! <br/>
The "cut-away" stream is something to experience!<br/>
<br/>
Found the Crestwood Challengers HH!<br/>
<br/>
Eagle Rock - Tahoe Pines - decided to try this on a whim - <br/>
unfortunately we chose the wrong path, and practically ended up in a <br/>
landslide - perhaps another time...<br/>
<br/>
We're off to Ontario, Canada on Sunday to look for a house to buy, <br/>
so will be out of the circuit for about 10 days - (hmmmmmm...there <br/>
ARE a few boxes up there already....!)<br/>
