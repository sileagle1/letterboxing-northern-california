<br/>
I've been quiet this week; birthdays and funerals this week and suddenly<br/>
it's Friday.  Whew.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone who's contacted me with support, suggestions and<br/>
offers of help.  You all have some great ideas and enthusiasm, and I<br/>
really appreciate it.  It's entirely likely I'll enlist some of you at<br/>
some point. :)<br/>
<br/>
I've created a quick little poll to see if we can nail down some specifics<br/>
on our proposed gathering.  Please take a moment to take this poll at:<br/>
http://www.ballot-box.net/service/poll.view.php?poll=69343<br/>
<br/>
If this URL doesn't work for you let me know and I'll fix it.<br/>
<br/>
Can everyone try to visit this poll within the next week?  We should at<br/>
least pick a venue soon so that we can reserve it if need be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
