Just was curiuos:  sometime back I read a post from Dog Scouts Troop <br/>
about log Book Binding with a link.   Did any one out there check <br/>
this page out?   Did any one out there try any of these ideas and if <br/>
they did which ones and did it work for you?  I was looking at the <br/>
one called Hand Carved Rubber Stamp book.  Wondering if this sounds <br/>
close enough to a log book or if it is way to complicated especially <br/>
if someone was going to make numeriuos Letterboxes. I need something <br/>
easy.........Thanks  M <br/>

I don't know if I used the same page or not, but on Saturday, I made <br/>
4 small "journals" which we're using as our logbooks (we did our <br/>
first letterbox on Sunday with our new homemade logbooks and our <br/>
homemade stamps!). It took probably 2 hours to make all 4, and I cut <br/>
materials for a fifth but didn't assemle it. They were my first hand-<br/>
made books. <br/>
<br/>
It would take longer to make a log book with more pages (mine had <br/>
about 12 pages, which is OK-- there are only a few letterboxes in my <br/>
county, and I can always make another book for out-of-town <br/>
letterboxes), because when you make more pages, your cover and <br/>
binding become more complicated.<br/>
<br/>
I made two small ones (about the size of a playing card) where <br/>
my "binding" was basically a ribbon run through two hole punches on <br/>
the edging and then tied, and two larger ones (1/4 sheet of paper <br/>
sized) where the binding was sewn. The sewn bindings would have bent <br/>
the smaller paper to much, but work OK on the larger sheets. I still <br/>
want to cover the stitching with some fabric or cardstock, but even <br/>
uncovered, it's not too ugly.<br/>
