                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from a week in Tahoe City.  Gary had a State<br/>
Employees conference and I went along for the R &amp; R.  <br/>
<br/>
We rarely get up the I-80 corridor heading east so this was our<br/>
opportunity to finally get some of the boxes up that way.  Of course,<br/>
we didn't even try for the long hike ones that climb up to the "nose<br/>
bleed" areas.  This of course was only due to time constraints, mind<br/>
you.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
We picked up a couple on the way up and a few on the way back.<br/>
<br/>
We got Doublesaj &amp; Old Blues I-80 Series boxes 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5.  We had<br/>
gotten box #1 earlier this year.<br/>

Lake Tahoe Mini Letterbox by Pad &amp; Foot Stamper.  A longer hike than<br/>
we anticipated, so threw us a little off schedule, but enjoyed the<br/>
trek and views.<br/>

After the Mishap by OBJuan<br/>
<br/>
Not a whopping amount, but some beautiful views and historical sites.<br/>
