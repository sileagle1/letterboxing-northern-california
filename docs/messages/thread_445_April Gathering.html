Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Is it a "for sure" that the April Gathering is going to be in Old<br/>
Town, Sacramento?  If in fact it is, how and what is the process from<br/>
here on out?  I will be glad to meet with some of the ones that live<br/>
close by such as Doublesaj and Old Blue and walk around the area to<br/>
check for available tables for meeting and picnicing and to get a<br/>
general "feel" for the place.  <br/>
<br/>
I think Discovery Park is very near, but since I haven't been down<br/>
there, I don't know what is actually there and how far it is from Old<br/>
Town.<br/>
<br/>
I know artTrekker is interested in scouting the area for possible<br/>
stamp carvings. Perhaps we can meet with Doublesaj, artTrekker and any<br/>
others that have an interest and check the possibilities.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that it is "open tax season", I/we will only be available on<br/>
Sundays, H&amp;R Block will keep us busy Monday through Saturday, until<br/>
April 15th!<br/>

I scouted for spots in Old Sac last Friday, and found  just the spot.  It's a <br/>
grassy spot in Old Sac..  It's bordered by "I" and "J" Streets, Front Street, <br/>
and Commonwealth Alley.  There are a couple of picnic tables there to use. If <br/>
it rains there are  some picnic tables just across Front Street under a roof. <br/>
So we'll be good to go  with sun or rain!<br/>
<br/>
Hope everybody is carving up stamps and ready to place  them. If we need a <br/>
meeting, I will be in that area on the weekend of Jan 15th,  we could meet at <br/>
the site if needed.<br/>
<br/>
I'll email to everybody that agreed to assist so we  can plan it out.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
  Being brand new, I'm not sure what goes on at these things.  I <br/>
assume you'll be hiding letter boxes, but around Old Sac?  Since I <br/>
about 5 miles from Old Sac, can I be of some help?  If you haven't <br/>
done so already, maybe I can check if there's anything else scheduled <br/>
that same weekend.<br/>

say that the main thing for the gathering is to have<br/>
lots of boxes to hunt for, so those of us that can<br/>

out for me, but you never know when I will get a wild<br/>
hair and just leave the hill.<br/>
