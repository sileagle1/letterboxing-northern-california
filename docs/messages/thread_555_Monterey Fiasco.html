So off we go to Monterey for a Fun weekend<br>
I was careful to pack all the local clues--- although reading them<br>
I wasn't sure I would be able to solve them on such short notice.<br>
anyway I was'nt sure how much time we would have for actually letterboxing<br>
Well with the rain pouring down nobody wanted to go hiking-<br>
opting for museums, aquariums, shopping, and restaraunts<br>
So I left my stamps and journal at the hotel.<br>
We go down to Fisherman's wharf and I pretty much<br>
run into one of the main clues for one of the boxes I had no idea where to <br>
start.<br>
(sigh) - message to self keep letterbox knapsack with me at all times...<br>
oh well next time I'm down that way I'll be able to get that one real <br>
easy!!!<br>
<br>
On the brighter side, We stopped at Mission San Juan Bautista and had a <br>
great time<br>
getting that Stamp. - Cool Placement, I don't think there is a stamp closer <br>
to the San Andreas Fault than that one. as a matter of fact, when you reach <br>
for the letterbox, your standing on the North American Plate, and the box <br>
sits on the Pacific Plate.<br>
<br>
Now that I am back I will finish the stamp for the letterboxing book and get <br>
that circulatiing<br>
Everybody who  emailed me asking to be on the list will get the box/book in <br>
turn, I will send out confirmation emails that I got your addresses.<br>

There's also a letterbox in Santa Cruz that sits on the San Andreas<br>
faultline on the epicenter of the 1987 quake. But I'm not sure if it's<br>
one different plates.<br>

On all those maps we see in school, the plates look like clearly<br>
distinct entities like it was a political boundry.  You'd be pretty<br>
hard pressed to draw a line directly in the dirt and say, "This is the<br>
ABC plate and this is the XYZ plate."  Places where I've stood on a<br>
fault line, the best I could do is say, "This side is the ABC plate,<br>
that side is the XYZ plate, and the fault line is the 20 feet between<br>
the two."<br>
<br>
But then, there are also many fault lines that are completely on a<br>
single plate.  For instance, if you visit downtown Hollister, you can<br>
see a fault line running right through town.  It's not often you can<br>
actually SEE a fault line.  And in truth, it's not so much the fault<br>
line you see but rather the damage it causes running along that line<br>
that's visible.<br>
<br>
One of my classes went out to Hollister on a geology fieldtrip.  =) <br>
Lots of fun running around the neighborhoods following the fault<br>
lines.  Sidewalks would have kinks in them where they shifted due to<br>
the fault.  Houses built on this line were slowly being torn in two,<br>
and many of the doors had to be specially cut to fit into the sheered<br>
doorways.  <br>
<br>
I tell you, if that doesn't deserve a letterbox, nothing does!  =) <br>
It's a creeping fault, though, and continues to move year after year. <br>
<br>
Anyhow.... happy trails!<br>
