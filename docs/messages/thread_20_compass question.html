A relatively cheap, basic compass is probably best for letterboxing.  <br/>
The VERY cheapest aren't all that great--they're more likely to break <br/>
or are so small you can't read the numbers.  But a good letterboxing <br/>
compass would probably be around $15.  Nothing fancy, but enough <br/>
quality where it won't fall apart easily.<br/>
<br/>
I found a webpage online at http://www.opticsgiant.com/compasses.html <br/>
that shows a whole bunch of compasses.  Of those listed, I'd probably <br/>
get the Suunto A-10 Partner Compass for $15.95.  Although depending <br/>
on your eyesight, the Suunto A-30L Woodsman Compass ($17) looks like <br/>
it might be a good choice since it appears to have a built-in <br/>
magnifier.  (My eyesight it pretty good, so I'd save the dollar by <br/>
going with the one without the magnifier.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not suggesting to get pricisely those models, though.  Those are <br/>
probably the all-around best TYPES of compasses to get for <br/>
letterboxes.  Any compass that looks more-or-less the same and sells <br/>
for about $15 will probably work just fine.  (More expensive ones <br/>
might work great too, but I can't figure out what you actually get <br/>
for the extra money.  The $15 ones work perfectly well.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!  =)<br/>

1 800 CAMPMOR or www.campmor.com. I think Santa could letterbox with either one.<br/>

Silva is considered an excellent brand name in compasses; mine cost <br/>
$10.00 and I'm at F87, so it must work.<br/>
