We don't know how long it has been gone.  Today was our first <br/>
maintenance trip to the box since placing it late last October.  Parts <br/>
of the trail were under water and there was evidence that some <br/>
cleaning up had been done along the way.  We never received any <br/>
reports from anyone who had ever searched for this letterbox.  It's <br/>
possible it's been gone awhile.<br/>
