                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for everyone that told me my Eureka letterbox may be missing.  <br/>
It was where it was supposed to be, it had just be shoved back far <br/>
enough that it was under the back of the pillar, not the front.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I went to enter my Fanny Ann's box into Atlasquest, but I'm not <br/>
sure out to classify it.  It was is a physical box for the GRR, but I'm <br/>
going to hold on to it &amp; it will kind of become a virtual box.  The <br/>
twist is that if someone wants to try to schedule it, I'll meet them at <br/>
Fanny Ann's so they can stamp into the box directly.  Otherwise, <br/>
they'll send me the final clue &amp; I'll send them a sticker of the <br/>
stamp.  So, is it a normal or virtual box.  Or since I'm kind of <br/>
carrying it with me, is it a personal traveller?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Add it as each type, so people can record the find as the type they<br/>
found it.  So those who found the physical box, it'll be a regular old<br/>
letterbox.  For those who find it virtually, it'll be a virtual box.<br/>
For those who find it as a personal traveler, it'll be a personal<br/>
traveler. You get the point.... =)<br/>
