I have a question about letterbox protocol. I am in the process of creating my first postal <br>
letterbox, however I thought it would be fun to share it at the gold rush gathering. Now <br>
there will be some qualifications to get the stamp. What do you all think? Appropriate, or <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am no expert so you really won't get any do's or don't from me.  However I think it would neat to take it with you as a PLB and have as many of us (hope to make a few hrs of this) stamp in.  Then when you return send it off like a PLB.  This gives anyone who signs up for an oppertunity to see what others have done in the way of a stamp.  I  think if you send it out even this afternoon you would have it home in time for April 30th. We have 3 other things going that day, so we are trying to figure out how we can get to Sacto and home again with time to spare.  I am not sure this is going to work which is sad because I have had my stamp ready for a few weeks now and all we need is to come search for that proper spot. Thinking of just asking someone to collect me all the clue sheets and we will go back another day because we have no time to search for anything.  The best we can do that day is possibly the exchanges... And of course meeting all the wonderful people who there.  I need to<br>
 note that I also do the PLB's , haven't recd.  many yet but I sure do enjoy getting them.  If you need any help with ?? just e-mail off list.  Getting ready soon to launch one of my own.....<br>
