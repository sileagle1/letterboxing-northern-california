Valor &amp; I headed out Monday A.M. to the coast. Rained all day. <br/>
Found:<br/>
<br/>
Bodega Bay<br/>
Deers of West Dartmoor-this one was great, just like being on the <br/>
moors. Rain, fog and cows!<br/>
Then headed north on 1 and attempted, but couldn't find Bookworm in <br/>
Point Arena. Didn't help that one of the clues had moved their shop <br/>
across the street and another clue wasn't there at all.<br/>
Found Box #5 of the St. Patrick series-nothing like walking in <br/>
pouring rain in the dark out in the middle of nowhere.<br/>
Dried off &amp; stayed over in Fort Bragg.<br/>
Day 2,<br/>
Box #1 of St. Pats series, a little difficult since road to use in <br/>
clues was closed and park only accessible by walk-in at a different <br/>
road and some trails led right into huge puddles/mini-lakes. But <br/>
worth the extra hike.<br/>
Boxes #2-4 were actually rain free and very pleasant.<br/>
Found one mystery box somewhere, and couldn't find another somewhere <br/>
else. <br/>
Found Harry Potter HH (great stamp LOL) but couldn't place in any of <br/>
the St Pats boxes cuz of size issues.<br/>
And Something Fishy HH<br/>
All boxes we found were in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
Great wet time!<br/>

boxing day in the rain and didn't have any interest in<br/>
looking for anything else. We are buried in white<br/>
stuff today, so boxing dreams must wait for the new<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
For you statistics followers: I found my first box<br/>
Sept. 16 and was hoping to get to F100 before the year<br/>
closed, but my numbers remain: P17 F82 X15 HH7<br/>
(Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue separate HH found from boxes<br/>
found--what about the rest of y'all?)<br/>
<br/>
stay warm and dry! &amp; keep carving,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I decided to follow the Wabbit's example and head out into the <br/>
rain, otherwise I just wasn't going to get any boxing done before <br/>
school starts (on Monday --- eek!).  I went out yesterday in the <br/>
downpour to replace the Survivor Amazon boxes - 1 &amp; 3 are back in place <br/>
(although moved slightly from their previous hiding spots) and 2 is <br/>
also alive and well, despite reports it was missing.  I was also able <br/>
to get Blackbird's Volcano along the way - the rain stopped for 10 <br/>
whole minutes while we stamped in!  I also found the Dia de los Muertos <br/>
HH while conducting the box maintenance, so I guess that's my reward <br/>
for doing my duty.  I have been a hitchhiker magnet recently - 4 in one <br/>
week!  My replanting efforts are almost over - I have the new Twisted <br/>
Candles and Year of the Ram ready to go, so it should not be long <br/>
before they are back online.<br/>
<br/>
On Thursday we went up to the northern counties and I was able to get <br/>
the 3 American Grafitti boxes and Aristacat.  Along the way we also <br/>
planted 2 boxes and got 3 of the California Sesquicentennial stamps. As <br/>
the ranger at the Sonoma Barracks was giving me the stamp, she <br/>
mentioned "Hey, have you heard of letterboxing?"  At first I thought <br/>
maybe it was a trap :-)   Then she proceeded to tell me how interested <br/>
she was in doing it, but that her friend was more into geocaching, <br/>
which she felt offered no challenge.  So I think I made a new convert!  <br/>
She says that the rangers in that area don't mind letterboxes, as long <br/>
as you ask permission to plant them.  If nothing else, it might be good <br/>
to have a mole on the inside of the State Parks System.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately we didn't have time to get to any of the boxes in <br/>
Sugarloaf, although I am salivating at the prospect.  We were headed up <br/>
to the Bale Grist Mill when it started pouring rain, and we saw the <br/>
folks we were going to meet to watch the game with walking down the <br/>
street in St. Helena.  There was a parking place right in front of the <br/>
tasting room where they were meeting up with everyone else, so we took <br/>
it as a sign from above that we should stop boxing for the day.  Has <br/>
anyone been up to see if the Basement Box is still there?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I've been meaning to mention that I checked on The Black Bird <br/>
box in San Francisco while I was Christmas shopping.  I can confirm it <br/>
is missing....again.  Unfortunately the Nature's Beauty HH was inside <br/>
of it, and I'm afraid it was lost with the box (sorry, Tara).  Due to <br/>
the volatility of this location, I decided to convert the clue into a <br/>
traveler and have carved the stamp FOR THE THIRD TIME, but modified it <br/>
a little.  So do your homework before the next time you see me and get <br/>
this stamp for your book.<br/>
<br/>
Well that about wraps it up - wishing everyone a very boxious New Year <br/>
- may your F counts be high in 2005.  Should we have a discussion on <br/>
our favorite boxes of this last year?<br/>
