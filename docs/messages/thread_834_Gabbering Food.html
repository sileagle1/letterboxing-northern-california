<br>
<br>
*"Minted Fruit Salad"*<br>
1 ripe cantaloupe<br>
1 honeydew melon<br>
1 pint strawberries<br>
1 pint blueberries<br>
3 kiwis<br>
1/4 C lemon juice<br>
1/2 C orange juice<br>
3 TBL sugar (optional, depending on sweetness of<br>
fruit)<br>
Handful of mint leaves<br>
<br>
Using a melon baller, scoop out the cantaloupe and melon.  Clean and hull the strawberries.  Peel and slice the kiwis.  Mince the mint leaves and sprinkle over the fruit.<br>
<br>
Mix the lemon and orange juice and add the sugar.  Pour over the fruit.  Let chill for about 3 hours.  <br>
Serves 12.<br>
<br>
Note:  Any fruit of the season will work well.  I usually chill the fruit and pour on the juice a little while before serving.  I've found that pouring it on and letting it chill for several hours tends to make the fruit a little soupy.<br>

<br>
<br>
*"Vegetable Medley"*<br>
1 bag Cauliflower, Broccoli, Carrots (thawed)<br>
1 can Cream of Mushroom Soup<br>
1/3 c. Sour Cream<br>
1 tsp. Pepper<br>
*Shredded Swiss Cheese<br>
*1 can French's (Durkee) Fried Onions<br>
<br>
Mix all in large bowl, adding only half Fried Onions and half Swiss Cheese.  Place in casserole dish and bake at 350 for 25 minutes.<br>
Remove to add rest of cheese and onions on top.  Bake 5 more minutes.<br>
WA-LA!!  Enjoy!<br>
