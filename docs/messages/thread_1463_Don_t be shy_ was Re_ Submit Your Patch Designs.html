                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's been brought to my attention that some people may be avoiding <br>
entering patch designs because of the intimidation of having their <br>
work published on the Pepe's well-known blog, so if those fears do <br>
exist, I want to allay them.  The voting page will not be available <br>
to the letterboxing public at large like most of the other pages on <br>
the blog.  The link to it will only be made known to the members of <br>
the California Yahoo groups.  This will keep the voting from being <br>
swayed by people who aren't really interested in the patches, and <br>
apparently it might also encourage any bashful artists out there as <br>
well. ;)  So please, submit away!<br>
<br>
And if there are any more comments or questions, please don't <br>
hesitate to ask.<br>
