                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's been brought to my attention that some people may be avoiding <br/>
entering patch designs because of the intimidation of having their <br/>
work published on the Pepe's well-known blog, so if those fears do <br/>
exist, I want to allay them.  The voting page will not be available <br/>
to the letterboxing public at large like most of the other pages on <br/>
the blog.  The link to it will only be made known to the members of <br/>
the California Yahoo groups.  This will keep the voting from being <br/>
swayed by people who aren't really interested in the patches, and <br/>
apparently it might also encourage any bashful artists out there as <br/>
well. ;)  So please, submit away!<br/>
<br/>
And if there are any more comments or questions, please don't <br/>
hesitate to ask.<br/>

&gt; So far there have only been three entries for our patch design, <br/>
(two <br/>
&gt; of them from the same person).  I'm considering extending the <br/>
&gt; deadline, but I don't want to do that if it won't make any <br/>
&gt; difference anyway.  If there's anyone who would submit a design if <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; extended the deadline by a week or so, please e-mail me and let me <br/>
&gt; know by the end of tomorrow.  If I don't hear from anyone, we'll go <br/>
&gt; ahead and vote on the three designs that we do have.<br/>
