                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to thank Don and Gwen for such a great time at their "camp" <br/>
last Saturday.  The Gatorlovers enjoyed this laid back visit with <br/>
everyone who came.  Pictures!  Stories!  Laughter!  And good food!<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to see everyone at The Gabbering in two weeks!  I'm excited <br/>
that Mim has opened her arms to us and is letting us "invade"!  Now we <br/>
have to go there before the Gabbering to get those boxes we haven't yet, <br/>
so that we might actually relax and visit better!<br/>
<br/>
Oh - wanted to share that the Gator "Gals" and Boxalot "Girls" went out <br/>
yesterday to San Fran and got a few boxes on our own.  We found a <br/>
wonderful box called Hawk Hill which we had to travel through some <br/>
tunnels to get to our prize.  I hope you all will have a chance to <br/>
"sing" while traveling the tunnels.  We did!  Opera!  Show tunes!  You <br/>
name it!  The acoustics are great!  We had a blast.  And we highly <br/>
encouraged the other visitors to do the same, even though they just <br/>
looked at us strangely!  HA!  I think their smiles were looks of <br/>
wariness, as they hoped we would go away quickly.  :)<br/>
<br/>
See you all soon!  And congrats on F500!  We too will be there some day, <br/>
...some day.<br/>
