                    <div class="plaintext-content">While working on #4 of my Cabinet of Curiosities boxes, I tried <br>
something new. I use the tissue paper transfer method to get my images <br>
onto carving material. After getting a pencil image, I usually use a <br>
fine point Sharpie to darken and sharpen the transfer image. BUT, I <br>
always end up smearing the image while working (both the Sharpie ink & <br>
the pencil smear). <br>
<br>
This time, I sprayed my tranferred image with workable fixative, which <br>
I spray lightly on my pastel paintings to "set" the pigment powder in <br>
place. For this purpose, I used a heavier coat on the stamp material. <br>
I found that it helped a lot. Smearing was reduced greatly, but not <br>
totally eliminated. <br>
<br>
I'll bet that hair spray would act the same way, though (and it's less <br>
expensive than workable fixative). With hair spray, I'd keep it light <br>
to avoid forming a crust.<br>
<br>
Anyone else have other solutions for smearing?<br>

I understand that, for sure. When I finish a pastel painting, it gets <br>
a very, very light amount of fixative, because I don't like what it <br>
does to the appearance of the pigment.<br>
<br>
Doesn't ball point smear, too? Maybe India ink is an answer...<br>

And they stain the rubber, so that I can "proof" the image, was off<br>
the printing ink, and still see my design on the stamp, itself.<br>
<br>
Does that make sense?<br>
