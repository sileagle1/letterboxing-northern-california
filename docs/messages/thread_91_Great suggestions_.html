Welcome to letterboxing Bridge. Bulls are extremely beautiful, and an <br/>
image of one will make a great personal stamp. I'm also a Taurus, and <br/>
an art lover, and incredibly stubborn (but I'm working on that). <br/>
Astrologically speaking, Taurus rules painting; maybe that's why I <br/>
married a UCLA art major.  <br/>
