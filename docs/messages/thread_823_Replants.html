                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been trying to get out to replant my various missing letterboxes <br>
and have the following boxes done so far:<br>
<br>
Crustacean Inlet (previously known as Crab Cove) - new locations on <br>
both boxes<br>
Witchypoo<br>
Go Bears! Tightwad Hill (I saw a family of wild turkeys with lots of <br>
babies while I was up there!  But also a homeless encampment nearby - <br>
go with a friend to this one)<br>
The Haunted Carousel (previously part of the Tilden Park series - I <br>
have retired Pony Rides)<br>
The Lion King - new location, clues revised<br>
Museum of Modern Art #1 - Skrik (will Da Kool Kats set a new land speed <br>
record to get there?)<br>
<br>
I have also heard that Playland Lives! may be missing - I will try to <br>
get out to the City soon, but it may have to wait until late August <br>
when I'm back from my trip to NY and CT.  Hope the above will keep you <br>
all busy and out of trouble until I return.<br>

As much as we'd like to be able to set a land speed record, we don't<br>
usually make trips to the bay area and the city (SF)to box unless we<br>
are going to be in that area for something else.  Hope it's still<br>
there when we do venture over.  Thanks for replacing and maintaining<br>
your boxes.<br>
