<br>
Thanks to the gracious Princess Lea I am a new member.  I have only <br>
been letterboxing for 6 weeks or so, stumbled upon it after seeing an <br>
article in my local paper about geocaching.  It immediately reminded <br>
of the NPR story about LB I heard ages ago while driving and promptly <br>
forgot.  A quick google search and I have been hooked ever since! I <br>
mostly have explored Princess Lea's and Paul in SF's boxes....very <br>
creative and fun.  <br>
<br>
It is amazing to me there are easily 100 geocaches in Sonoma County <br>
but only 3-4 letterboxes.  My mission is to change that: already <br>
planted five boxes with more to come.  Hope to make the GG gathering, <br>
not sure about timing as we will just be back from the East COast <br>
visiting family.  A great opportunity to get some letterboxes there. <br>
 <br>
Glad to find your group; it sounds like a great bunch of folk from the <br>
posts I have read.  Is there a secret handshake?  Slogan?  Initiation <br>
rite?  How do I cast a spell on my boxes to keep them from going MIA?<br>
<br>
Sincerely, Mimulus<br>
PS.  Due to technical difficulties I have posted clues to the Sonoma <br>
County boxes under my DH Steve's name/email.   <br>

SHE HAS ALREADY PLANTED FIVE BOXES!!!!!  Hooray for enthusiastic <br>
newbies!  You may want to utilize my little trick of writing "this is <br>
not a geocache" on your boxes - they have been known to remove stamps <br>
as trade items.<br>
