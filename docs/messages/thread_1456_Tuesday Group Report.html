I thoroughly enjoyed myself with Lea, NIls and Renee.  Unfortunaltey<br>
duty called so I was unable to accompany them on all their appointed<br>
rounds (or should I say scheduled, Lea?)<br>
<br>
I am sad to say I found out last night a good friend is gettign<br>
married  on April 1st.  Interestign choice of dates, second marriages<br>
for both. so hopefully they are Fool sfor love, or someting like that.<br>
 I relly am disappointed to not be in San Jose for the next event. If<br>
only I could clone myself......<br>

manic, and yes, I "allowed" the troops a whole 1/2 break before<br>
returning to the precisely organized itinerary.<br>
<br>
Late breaking news!  Amanda just called as I was writing this to say<br>
she has a layover in San Francisco tomorrow.  I'm going to pick her up<br>
early and then scoot up to Vacaville - cross your fingers that the<br>
rain won't be too bad.  Anybody care to join us?  Bring your rain<br>
slickers!<br>

<br>
I, too, love the Holy Canoli letterbox.  For me, one of the great<br>
pleasures of letterboxing is getting to discover those special "who<br>
knew this was there?" type places, and this letterbox really<br>
exemplifies this   sort of experience.<br>
<br>
I love the description of "ants."  Great image!  (tromp tromp tromp.....)<br>
<br>
So, after eleven working days in a row, I finally have a day off, and<br>
despite the crummy weather, Robb and I plan to try to scoop up a<br>
letterbox or two.<br>

Oh, I was so rushed by the employee kicking me out that I didn't even <br>
look at the book other than to stamp it, so I didn't know I was <br>
supposed to take a word.  I guess my word should have been something <br>
like "timeliness".<br>
