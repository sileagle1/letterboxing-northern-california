&gt; We WERE going to Tahoe but too much snow!<br/>
<br/>
You were coming to Tahoe? So sorry we're inhospitable<br/>
at the moment! I can say without doubt that all boxes<br/>
are buried...oh, except Happy Holidays temporary. As I<br/>
write, CalTrans is blasting the mountain, using bigger<br/>
guns than usual...they are shaking the whole house<br/>
each time. Plus, this is a terrible weekend to come<br/>
here--traffic will be a parking lot straight through<br/>
Monday. You will have other chances this winter,<br/>
though, and when you decide to come, let me know, so<br/>
we can arrange an exchange or something! Happy New<br/>
Year to you both!<br/>

p.s. looked for Best of Davis #5 late in the wind on<br/>
Sunday...looked at almost every tree, but no joy. I<br/>
really must overthink some of these clues!<br/>
