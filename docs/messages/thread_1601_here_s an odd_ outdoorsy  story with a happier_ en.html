Yes! We have a latterbox in the "I-80 series" called "Rainbow Bridge" which is the bridge that very bear is climbing on! We had to move the box just a little a couple of months ago when we checked on reports there was a Geocache nearby. . .too nearby as it turned out. <br/>
<br/>
Do you suppose that bear WAS OB Juan and he was going after the box!!??<br/>

Maybe you native Californians are jaded to this sort of news, but this<br/>
little Marylander is totally delighted by the whole story.<br/>
