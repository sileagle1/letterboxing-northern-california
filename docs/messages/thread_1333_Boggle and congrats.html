The few boggle letters I managed to make impressions of are just<br/>
beautiful and I am kicking myself now for not really GETTING it while<br/>
at BASS.  I tend to morph into a deer in the headlights at the sheer<br/>
magnificence of what a letterboxing event can be.  overwhelmed just<br/>
begins to describe it.  Yes, please do bring to another event!  Maybe<br/>
the vacaville one..<br/>
<br/>
but again I am feeling like I hardly spoke to anyone...like you or<br/>
audrey, sierra sally the grumpy grinches, etc. etc.  ..too many<br/>
distractions.  Another gabbering could be in order.  And a few more<br/>
circus performers, oui?<br/>
<br/>
And kudos for hitting 1000!<br/>

I agree!  I read the 'zine last night and then<br/>
understood the game. I get really overwhelmed in the<br/>
field, I'm sorry! The letters you carved were really<br/>
pretty and the game sounds fun! I like the idea a lot!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to DemXXmen for making that 'zine. A lot of<br/>
handi-work and creativity went into it. It's nice to<br/>
have a neat souvenir of the event other than stamp<br/>
impressions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Eclipse and Kathy for your coordination and to<br/>
everyone who so generously chipped in with lots of<br/>
food, water, drinks, and those cookies, and those <br/>
brownies. Those really helped perk me up towards the<br/>
end of the day. =)<br/>
