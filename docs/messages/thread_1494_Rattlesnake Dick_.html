want to go there every day (it's been a long winter trying to explain<br>
over & over again a 3 yr old why an open topped train doesn't run during<br>
the rainy season).<br>
 <br>
Are you going to the Gathering next weekend?  It's pretty much right on<br>
the way for you if you do.  Otherwise, I can pick it up & send it to<br>
you, or hold on to it, which ever you prefer.<br>

I can go and pick it up (and let them yell at me) on Friday. How's that sound? Why don't you email a letter to me saying that you give permission for me to pick it up.<br>
