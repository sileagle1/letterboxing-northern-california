                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of weekends ago I went down to the Monterey Peninsula for the <br>
weekend and found the following boxes:<br>
<br>
San Carlos Borromeo del Rio Carmelo<br>
Point Pinos Lighthouse<br>
Om.....<br>
Los Lobos Marinos<br>
<br>
There was a wedding going on at the Mission in Carmel and the bride and <br>
groom were just exiting the basilica when we got there.  We tried to <br>
surreptitiously get out of their way and thought we'd found a quiet <br>
spot in back by a fountain, when suddenly the whole wedding party came <br>
out there to take pictures.  Ack!  Luckily they couldn't have cared <br>
less what we were doing, but it was flustering.<br>
<br>
We also attempted Pigeon Point Lighthouse but it appears to be missing. <br>
  I saw some likely looking rocks which probably concealed the box at <br>
one time, but the container is long gone now.  Boo hoo.  I've seen the <br>
image in Amanda's book and this was a nice stamp.<br>
<br>
One other thing I wanted to mention about the wonderful new letterboxes <br>
that have been planted in the Bay Area recently is that I noticed that <br>
several were planted on National Park land (Point Reyes, the Presidio). <br>
  It's my understanding that the National Parks Service does not look <br>
kindly upon letterboxes and geocaches and considers them trash; they <br>
may destroy (or at best, remove) them if they are found.  Also, I'm <br>
fairly certain that my Skywalker Ranch boxes were pulled by rangers, <br>
and they were on state land.  I have been advised not to list the name <br>
of any National Parks in my clues to make it harder for the rangers to <br>
track them down.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I didn't even realize that the Presidio was a national park...oops.  <br>
Guess it would be wise to look into that first next time :P  <br>
Hopefully they won't be discovered....and maybe I'll change the <br>
clues to not mention the presidio or inspiration point.<br>
Thanks for the heads up!<br>
