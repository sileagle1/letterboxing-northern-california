How well do the Altoids tins stand up to wet weather? The two boxes <br/>
I found that used these were in pretty dry sheltered locations. <br/>

We try to only use them where they are fairly protected from the rain, under metal objects such as stairs. We have used them in other locations and used small baggies to try to keep the log dry but it is iffy. The round tin seems to work best as the lid is tighter than the square tin. Ryan was right on with the 35mm film canister, they stay dry if the finder puts the lid back on properly. Gwen found one of DVN2RCKR,s completely under water, hanging upside down attached with a small magnet. When we opened it up to our supprise every thing was dry. Unfortunately we were out of film in our camera and I was unable to capture Gwen wading in 6 inch deep water to get the letterbox. I had to remain under the umbrella keeping our gear and her hiking boots dry. Well someone had to stay dry!<br/>
