located a geocache/letterbox hybrid in Alameda's Neptune Beach <br/>
area.  Sunday we celebrated Grumpy's Mother's 83rd birthday and were <br/>
the first finders of punkin head's Grateful Dead #1 - He's Gone <br/>
stamp in Sunol.  We received a bonus "scroll" attesting that we were <br/>
the first, which we taped in our logbook opposite the Jerry Garcia <br/>
stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is truly a gift to ourselves as we hike into <br/>
retirement!  This week it took us to numerous beautiful locations we <br/>
would never have seen otherwise.  We ate wild blackberries, bathed <br/>
our feet in the Stanislaus River, and just gloried in California's <br/>
beautiful scenery.  Hope to meet some of our fellow "boxers" on the <br/>
trail in the future.<br/>
