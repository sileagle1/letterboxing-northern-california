aT, I'd love to "box" with you (how are you at boxing in the dark?<br>
ha!) but I'm not so sure it would be all that much fun in CT, if in<br>
fact, the boxes are all that plentiful.  Attached is a post from LbNA<br>
today.  Boxing there just doesn't seem to be challenging enough. Maybe<br>
it's not just about the F count.  <br>

Don't let the braggards get you down. They probably live in CT. Her<br>
Ladyship is told that the entire state looks as if it were paved with<br>
Tupperware; that a stroll through the woods of CT sounds like burrito<br>
night in the colitis ward from stepping on so many Tupperware<br>
containers. Her Ladyship also lives in a sparsely boxed area and<br>
rarely finds time to venture far afield. There are other things in<br>
life that draw ones attention. If one is only in it for the F count<br>
(and it seems more and more clear that many of the high F's have<br>
dubious counting methods but that's just between you and her Ladyship)<br>
then one is perhaps missing the point. <br>

It's just that boxing struck the right nerve, so when I can take a day, or when I'm already traveling, to see family or friends or for work, I go boxing. Because I'm an artist, and drawing is my nemesis and my foundation, I try to draw in my logbook whenever I can (often I'm too greedy for the next box to take the time to sit and draw). Every year I have a New Tear's resolution to draw more, and boxing has just filled the motivation spot for that. It's probably why I'm not carving as much as I would like to be. When I'm home, I need to be working on my "real" art projects. Did you find Healdsburg #1 yet?<br>

Carole, I'm great at boxing in the dark. I've done my share. Let's go! Great news about Connecticut--I didn't want to go there anyway. Mimulus said that when she went boxing back east, about half of the boxes she sought were missing. I hate that.<br>
<br>
Last night I found some fun art for GGR stamps. Time to carve! If I can allow it...and stay home for awhile. I hope everyone is staying warm!<br>
