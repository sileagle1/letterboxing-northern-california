aT, I'd love to "box" with you (how are you at boxing in the dark?<br/>
ha!) but I'm not so sure it would be all that much fun in CT, if in<br/>
fact, the boxes are all that plentiful.  Attached is a post from LbNA<br/>
today.  Boxing there just doesn't seem to be challenging enough. Maybe<br/>
it's not just about the F count.  <br/>

Dearest Rebbeca,<br/>

Don't let the braggards get you down. They probably live in CT. Her<br/>
Ladyship is told that the entire state looks as if it were paved with<br/>
Tupperware; that a stroll through the woods of CT sounds like burrito<br/>
night in the colitis ward from stepping on so many Tupperware<br/>
containers. Her Ladyship also lives in a sparsely boxed area and<br/>
rarely finds time to venture far afield. There are other things in<br/>
life that draw ones attention. If one is only in it for the F count<br/>
(and it seems more and more clear that many of the high F's have<br/>
dubious counting methods but that's just between you and her Ladyship)<br/>
then one is perhaps missing the point. <br/>

Carole, I'm great at boxing in the dark. I've done my share. Let's go! Great news about Connecticut--I didn't want to go there anyway. Mimulus said that when she went boxing back east, about half of the boxes she sought were missing. I hate that.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I found some fun art for GGR stamps. Time to carve! If I can allow it...and stay home for awhile. I hope everyone is staying warm!<br/>
