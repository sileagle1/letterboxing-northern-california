Hi,<br>
I made it to 2 of your Folsom Kids' Park boxes yesterday & found that <br>
the books that had what I felt were inappropriate messages in them. <br>
Based on the handwritting, it looked like a junior high aged <br>
kid "stamped" in & wrote unpleasant & derogatory things about someone <br>
they knew. They also wrote rude comments on other pages where people <br>
had already stamped. Just wanted to let you know so you could deal <br>
with it as appropriate.  I'd be happy to help with them if you're <br>
unavailable.<br>
Thanks,<br>
Black Cavalier<br>
