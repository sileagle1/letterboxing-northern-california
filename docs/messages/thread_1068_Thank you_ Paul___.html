It was great to get together with everyone and have such a wonderful<br>

<br>
Robb and I were giggling because several really crazy ideas that we<br>
had been kicking around were suggested by the group.  It would be very<br>
amusing to see multiple in                   terpretations of some of<br>

Thanks from me too Paul.  I hate to say it, but after sharing all our <br>
ideas & discussions, my wife came with an idea for an even more evil <br>
prank box than any of us did.  Of course, I'm not going to share it <br>
since I'm going to try to implement it as soon as possible.<br>

to you Paul for such a wonderful workshop we all<br>
shared yesterday.  I went in thinking in one way about<br>
all this (very happily might I add) and left thinking<br>
in a completely different way (a kind of "thousand<br>
happiness" way!!).  Like Nils, Lisa and Robb, I can't<br>
wait to see what everyone comes up with-- we should<br>
have wonderful boxing this summer!!!!!<br>
<br>
I will also say that it was so GREAT to see fellow<br>
LBNCA boxers, and meet some new faces to go with the<br>
stamps I've seen on the trail.  I had such fun<br>
brainstorming with you all.  I think of us, a bunch of<br>
adult types in our little groups giggling about the<br>
missions Paul set us on-- what a nice way to get to<br>
know you a bit better.  Whenever anyone asks me about<br>
my hobby, I do tell about the stamps, logbooks, etc---<br>
but I also maintain that it's about the PEOPLE who do<br>
this...<br>
<br>
Anyway, there I go getting all silly. Happy trails you<br>
guys and thanks so much again Paul!<br>
