11am -3pm with potluck lunch at 12.  That would allow for morning or <br/>
late afternoon boxing or time for folks to drive back home and not <br/>

I live in a neighborhood of about 70 homes three miles from Santa <br/>

fun to have a fex boxes hidden here in the neighborhood for some <br/>
group expeditious boxing.  OF course, not too many, the idea is to <br/>
hang out and talk after all. I was hoping to get Boch's Travelling <br/>

might be fun, or a west coast version of traveling circus.  Or just <br/>
any ole random thing.  I dont mind hiding boxes if you live far and <br/>
want to mail one to me.  <br/>

<br/>
I am looking forward to meeting you all - and thanks so much for all of the expressions of sympathy that so many of you have sent to me regarding my Dad.  We were able to get down to Old Sac and hunt the remaining boxes - and had a great time - but would have been fun to share it with all of you.  Loved that camo aT....and Black Cavalier - we need found the oh-so-fun Fanny Ann's "box" - just need to get with you to get our stamp on that  one.<br/>
<br/>
See you all in July (if not sooner on the trail!) - Honour (of the Boxalots)<br/>
