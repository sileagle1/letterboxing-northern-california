WE are going Letterboxing come rain or shine New Years Day!  I am <br/>
having withdrawls it's been so long. {I do however have all those <br/>
neat exchanges I obtained right before Christmas} You know who you <br/>
all are TY.... Jeff and I want more.. more.. more..  so I am looking <br/>
for some easier type ones so even if it is raining we will not be <br/>
hiking.  Since it is hard for him to hike anyway I don't want him or <br/>
I to have a spill somewhere on a mountain side.   Maybe Peteluma? For <br/>
American Grafitti?  Wascally are they easy?   I also thought maybe <br/>
Holy Canoli Batman?  Any other easy ones close to Peteluma?  Any <br/>
ideas are more than welcome.  <br/>
As for those of you who responded back on the  Series of Unfortunate <br/>
Events:  WE have figured this one out.  I put my head together with <br/>
my sons girlfriend who also went to the movie with me and she <br/>
actually figured out what needed to be done.  I think we have it all <br/>
now but Da Kool Kats have told me not to attempt this one until we <br/>
have dry weather. So I am taking that advice and heading that <br/>
direction in a few weeks.  TY for your responses.  <br/>
Everyone have a Great New Years Eve... Will be posting in 2005!!  <br/>

<br/>
Holy Canoli Batman is great...you can drive there,<br/>
just follow the clues. I don't know if you're going as<br/>
far north as Healdsburg, but the quartet is accessible<br/>
without a lot of walking. I can give you a couple of<br/>
offline shortcuts if you need to walk even less. Have<br/>
fun &amp; stay dry!<br/>
