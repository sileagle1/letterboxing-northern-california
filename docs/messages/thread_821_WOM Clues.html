I'd start slow. Try entering the WOM title on lb.org and AQ and see what <br/>
happens. If you don't have anyone finding the box in, say, 6 months, try a new <br/>
tack. But first, think of a plan for when you get an email asking outright for <br/>
the clue or other situations like that. <br/>

Most of the WOM clues that I have seen in my experience WOM clues are <br/>
*not* passed along unless approved by the planter.  I guess you have to <br/>
option of letting people know whether or not they can be passed on.<br/>
<br/>
On an unrelated topic, Anna &amp; the Kids are on fire!  6 new boxes!    <br/>
Don't know if we Cal faithful are going to be able to manage to set <br/>
foot on the farm to get them - what say you Old Blue?<br/>
<br/>
And too bad all the new ones our local boy Paul in SF are planting are <br/>
all back East.<br/>

I say put aside those old rivalries and c'mon down to<br/>

I say bummer too for Paul's boxes so far away-- I LOVE<br/>
