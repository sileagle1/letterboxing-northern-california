  Took a quick trip through southern Idaho last weekend for family<br/>
  visiting.  Tried for 2 boxes, but both seemed missing (Emily's Decade &amp;<br/>
  Hockey Puck Out of Bounds).  But, did get an exchange with A-Bear, an<br/>
  extrememly helpful boxer who lives outside Boise.  She sent me lists of<br/>
  so many boxes along our route that it took 10 double sided pages in 8<br/>
  point font to print out.  If anyone's going between Boise &amp; Idaho Falls,<br/>
  let me know &amp; I'll send you the list.  It was frustrating to know we<br/>
