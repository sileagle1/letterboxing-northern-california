<br>
I'm writing to introduce our family to you, and with a question.<br>
<br>
We got into letterboxing a couple of months ago through our son, who enjoys<br>
Ranger Rick magazine. Did you know there was a 2-month cartoon story about<br>
letterboxing there? (May and June issues if I remember correctly). We<br>
promptly got on the website after reading the June issue and proceeded to<br>
visit (I think) almost all the Oakland, Berkeley, and one Alameda boxes. We<br>
sign as Saturn and its Rings. We also place a series of 3 letterboxes in<br>
Point Reyes ("Alien in Pt. Reyes"), where I'm concerned they were probably<br>
found and destroyed (alas!). Our name for the letterboxes we make is Alien<br>
Explorers. Our son then placed another box ("Restoration") with my sister<br>
(his aunt).<br>
<br>
We're loving letterboxing, and have plans for more. We love hiking in<br>
general, so letterboxing is giving some purpose to some of our hikes.<br>
<br>
We're two moms and an almost-6-year-old.<br>
<br>
My question to you is: are there other children involved? We want to come to<br>
the gathering, but hope it's multi-generational rather than only adults (my<br>
mom's visiting, too!).<br>
<br>
And who knows... maybe we'll plant a box in the park before the gathering!<br>
