I did!  I remember doing a letterbox search on the Yahoo Groups and <br/>
found a yahoo group for practically every state in the country.  But <br/>
there were two problems with them: Nobody was using them and I didn't <br/>
create them so I couldn't moderate them.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I think the other groups were created for the same reason I created <br/>
this group, but the letterboxing community hadn't reached "critical <br/>
mass" for the groups to flourish like they have now.  Well, some <br/>
states still haven't reached critical mass, but happily, more and <br/>
more of them are!<br/>
