                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a little Valentine's Day present to myself I got out and did a <br/>
little letterboxing in the South Bay yesterday and went three for <br/>
three.  A banner day!  And they were all darling hand-carved stamps, <br/>
which I always appreciate.  It was the first time I've been able to get <br/>
out onto the paths for over a month!<br/>
<br/>
First I went to Mission Santa Clara and found my first Sierra Sally <br/>
stamp - loved it!  I do hope to be able to get more of this series.  <br/>
Although it's a fairly new box, it has already had about 6-7 visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Next I went back for a 2nd try at the 2 Weathergleam boxes in Mountain <br/>
View/Palo Alto.  I had tried Baylands Memories before and got turned <br/>
around, making a 2 mile "side trip" and ran out of time.  It turns out <br/>
there are 2 Adobe Creek Loops - I've pointed this out to the planter <br/>
and he agrees that he needs to change his clues.  So, if you do go to <br/>
this box, take the one on the RIGHT (not straight/left), but not the <br/>
uphill path either.<br/>
<br/>
The other Weathergleam box is called LTA and you could actually get <br/>
there from Baylands Memories if you took a long-ish hike (2 miles or so <br/>
one way); however, all the paths are very flat and perfect for bike <br/>
riding and it would be interesting to do these together.  I had some <br/>
trouble following the clues (I tried to figure them out on the way back <br/>
too, and they still didn't make sense), but if you get to the area <br/>
where you can see the Hangar and find the bench, you should be fine.  I <br/>
was only the second finder on this box (the other one had about 4-5) <br/>
and it doesn't surprise me as it was very well hidden.  I was wearing <br/>
headphones and also my compass on a string around my neck and got <br/>
horribly entangled in all the branches of the tree, but I guess it was <br/>
worth it.<br/>
<br/>
As I was leaving Byxbee Park, a little bell rang waaaaay in the back of <br/>
my brain that there used to be other letterboxes planted in this park, <br/>
but that most had gone missing almost immediately.  I tried to look <br/>
them up on the LbNA old web site but to no avail.  Did anyone on this <br/>
group ever find them?  Do they know if they are still around?  Do they <br/>
still have a copy of the clues?<br/>

We hunted down this series two summers ago. We only found one of the <br/>
boxes. I e-mailed the owner but never received a response. Later, <br/>
others stated that they were unable to find any boxes. I do have a <br/>
copy of the clues.<br/>
