We have discovered what we believe to be a NEW letterboxing letter <br>
count:  PF, which stands for premature find.  We made a trek to Santa <br>
Rosa today and were the pleased first finders on the first four of <br>
Mimulus's Dudley's been kidnapped series.  Fabulous stamps in a most <br>
awesome environment.  Combined with a good cardio workout, it was a <br>
great series.  Somehow we arrived at the final site to rescue Dudley <br>
and the RCMP payroll, and his evil captor had not yet brought him to <br>
the site!  PF!!  Here we came to save the day, only to be foiled <br>
again!  Zounds!!!<br>
