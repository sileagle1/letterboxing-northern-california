<br/>
I'm so snowed in with work that I don't see myself getting out 'boxing<br/>
anytime soon.  I'm happy that the Eros deadline will be expanded.<br/>

<br/>
Would anyone be interested in seeing the first preview of "Finn in the<br/>
Underworld" at Berkeley Repertory Theatre?  I've got a few extra tickets?<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to act fast, as the tickets are for Thursday October 6th,<br/>
at 8pm.  Berkeley Rep is just around the corner from the BART.<br/>
<br/>
If you're coming to see my fine work, don't get too excited.  I *did*<br/>
hand print an awful lot of wallpaper for this show, but the painters<br/>
are actually prety badly behind on this one.  We'll pull it together<br/>
for Opening Night, of course.<br/>
<br/>
The show is probably not for kids.  I haven't seen any of the<br/>
rehearsals, but it sounds pretty dark.<br/>

<br/>
Give me a call, if you are interested.<br/>
