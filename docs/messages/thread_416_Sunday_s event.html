Thanks again to Blackbird for the facilities yesterday - they were just <br/>

Blackbird<br/>
Alien Explorers (2/3)<br/>

SF Momo aka Wahoo!<br/>
RedSF<br/>
Cellissimo<br/>
Scott from SF, whose trail name kept changing so I'm not sure what to <br/>
call him<br/>
artTrekker (Surprise!  I think she gets the long distance award for <br/>
traveling from Tahoe) and dog Digger<br/>
Mimulus<br/>
<br/>
We forgot to take pictures!  D'oh!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone for taking time out of their busy holiday <br/>
schedules.  I learned some helpful hints too, such as it is a good idea <br/>
to scuff up some of the carving material with sandpaper so that they <br/>
will accept ink better.  I am glad that the demo was helpful to so <br/>
many, and hope that it translates to more wonderful hand-carved boxes <br/>
throughout Northern California.<br/>

--- I was there, I was there! Thank you Blackbird for hosting.  <br/>
Thanks you Princess Lea for all you did, and to everyone who was in <br/>
attendance Sunday for all your advice tips and mostly your <br/>
friendship.   I feel that I made a whole new bunch of Letterboxing <br/>
friends whom I can't wait to see again in the spring at the get <br/>
together, or sooner.  I did however get losssssssst on the way out of <br/>
there though.  :(  I ended up somehow missing the way home and <br/>
doubling back.  Next thing I knew I was back at the exit I originally <br/>
took to get there.  My husband thankfully talked me thru it.  I <br/>
wasn't feeling well all day (this darn cold) and I was even more <br/>
upset going home.  I did make it back safe and sound and had a great <br/>
wonderful day.  I have more exchange stamps than I originally had <br/>
from just going out LBing. And I can't forget my Event stamp also. I <br/>
plan on purchasing a new book to put everything in, so this batch has <br/>
to be pasted on , but I am looking foreward to finding many more that <br/>
I can just stamp in with.  So here is wishing you and Yours the <br/>
Happiest of Holidays and we hope to see you on trail in 2005!  Thansk <br/>
again for a great day...<br/>
