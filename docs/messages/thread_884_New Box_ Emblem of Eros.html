I am certainly considering getting into my car right now!  I am <br>
planning on being in the city on Thursday - anyone who can get there <br>
before me, I throw down the gauntlet!  Actually Anna beat me to all the <br>
others ones.....  I am bummed that Zephyrus really is gone - I was so <br>
excited when the 11 year old I was with was able to identify a jade <br>
tree, as I had no idea what one looked like.  Must. Get. To. Paul's. <br>
Boxes. Faster.<br>

I understand you wanting to have the box be available only a limited<br>
time, but why the 20th as opposed to some other date around then?<br>

<br>
I KNEW someone would ask me that question! It's sort of an arbitrary <br>
date, but it's also 1) just after my sabbatical, and 2) just before <br>
Halloween. I may want to plant a short-term Halloween themed box <br>
around then to replace it. <br>
<br>
I figure it's more helpful if I set a date in advance, rather than <br>
surprise folks and then extend the retirement of the box. I need the <br>
date simply to stay organized, I suppose.<br>
<br>
BTW, if anyone needs more time to hunt for the box... just ask -- I'll <br>
gladly leave it in place as needed. Of course, I'd rather keep them in <br>
place, and not lose so many of my boxes. I may bring boxes out of <br>
retirement periodically, too. At least, that's my current plan.<br>

So am I. But I can see where someone would want it -- it's an image <br>
that can be stamped onto just about anything, such as greeting <br>
cards. It turned out pretty well, and my carving gets better & <br>
better with time.<br>
<br>
I honestly believe that a non-letterboxer watches for my boxes and <br>
goes for them to take the stamps. <br>
<br>
Am I being paranoid? <br>
<br>
Zephyrus & Notus were fairly direct clues. But then, why hasn't 'The <br>
Therapeutist' vanished as well? That's fairly direct, too. Why <br>
did 'Star-Crossed survive so well, despite so many weddings, <br>
photographers, and planners?<br>

While we're sure it's happened, we are of the mind that the world is not out <br>
to get our boxes but rather where the boxes are placed that makes them go <br>
missing. If you place a box where transients "live", they will take your <br>
Tupperware, If you place a box where high school kids go, they will dig it out and <br>
trash it. Or where there are lots and lots of people all the time, where people <br>
will see you climbing up a hill to root around for something under a rock or in <br>
a 6 foot high tree knot, your boxes will be taken! <br>
<br>
While it is not a good idea to travel off delineated paths in sensitive <br>
areas, you really need to be aware of the foot traffic of any location you're <br>
pondering <br>
to place a box. There area many "scenic" and touristy spots that simply are <br>
not so popular because they don't appeal to or they are too much of a trek for <br>
most.  Or, give us a reason to be there--a bench to sit on with a box in reach <br>
or a big rock to lean against while our fingers go a' walking. THESE are the <br>
places to put a box!<br>
