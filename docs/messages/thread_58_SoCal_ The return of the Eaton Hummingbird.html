the 1st one I ever stamped into (I found the 1st one, "The Eaton <br>

recarved the stamp in the image of the 1st one (a bit bigger), and <br>
placed it in the orignal spot, using the clues of the orignal <br>
placers, so I don't consider this to be a new letterbox find or <br>
placement.  The hike to these falls was taken and written about by <br>
John Muir in the 19th century, so you'll be literally travelling in <br>
his footsteps.<br>

I hope this placement lasts a little longer than the first, but a lot <br>
of people visit this location, and the hiding place really isn't that <br>
discreet. I first stamped into this box on 2/22/03, so it's been just <br>
shy of a year. Leslie is the first to stamp into the new box. <br>
