I've always heard that there are terrible monsters that attack and eat <br/>
you once you leave the BART station anywhere across the Bay. How do <br/>
you manage to avoid them AND plant letterboxes?<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of monsters, some drunk ones stumbled out of the Castro <br/>
Halloween party last night and came up my street. Upon seeing the <br/>
Ultimate Letterboxing Scooter Vehicle, they mistook it for their <br/>
parole officer, and shoved it over onto the pavement, and quite <br/>
roughly. I left the house for work this morning to find two messed up <br/>
mirrors, a smashed in tail light, some cracks and scrapes, and the <br/>
contents stored under the seat were strewn across the sidewalk along <br/>
with liquor bottles. <br/>
<br/>
Why can't these folks just do something more peaceful... like, <br/>
maybe... letterbox? Huh?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another lovely weekend... and it even included some letterboxing. <br/>
Robb and I enjoyed today's beautiful weather, and were fortunate<br/>
enough to find Frolicsome Frog by the Grinchies, as well as the Lake<br/>
View at Tilden Park series by Pawca.   Both were lovely walks. <br/>
Thanks, guys!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder that I didn't bump into OBJuan, because I think we were both<br/>
up on Fish Ranch Road, planting letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever have one of those "breakthrough moments," where things<br/>
work out *exactly* as well as you envision?  I had one of those,<br/>
creating the Fish Ranch stamp.  I was giggling with glee as I carved<br/>
this one.  I'm hoping that you all enjoy this one half as much as I did.<br/>

I wonder if it will be anything like the Fish Camp drawings Sleepy Cat <br/>
did a few years ago when we were out in Yosemite.  I seem to remember a <br/>
picture of somefish doing macrame and pitching a tent.  So Lisa, are we <br/>
talking Cowboy Fish here?<br/>
<br/>
And congratulations to Black Cavalier on meeting his goals!  I think <br/>
the 10:1 ratio of finds to plants is just about right.  While some <br/>
people certainly plant more than they find, I am saddened by those who <br/>
find without planting.  I think it is only right to "give back" to the <br/>
hobby.  Speaking of which, I better go finish that carving I'm working <br/>
on.<br/>
