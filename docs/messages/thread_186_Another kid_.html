WE are coming with our 5 1/2 year old, a boy, code name Hissy (as in <br>
Madagascar hissing cockroach).  <br>
<br>
Unfortunatley he is getting a bit bored with letterboxing!  Can you <br>
believe it?  Unfortunately on a trip back to the East Coast two weeks <br>
ago we went on half a dozen hunts and was skunked on all but one.  <br>
Plus he is a bit lazy and just hates it when we drag him on long <br>
walks.  But that is the whole point, to get out for fresh air, <br>
exercise and some fun finding a box.  Gotta find more kid friendly <br>
boxes. <br>
<br>
Speaking of kid friendly boxes It sounds like you may live in Marin <br>
Satrun's Ring.  If you are up Sonoma County way, the "Holy Canoli! <br>
Batman" box is very kid friendly.  I am working on more.   (involving <br>
PEanuts, TinTIn, Asterix.  <br>
<br>
WE are bringing our bikes with us to the picnic, and perhpas stomp <br>
rockets, kites to keep Hissy happy.  Maybe even our croquet set, but <br>
may rethink that one in light of head injury potential.  (Hissy is <br>
still a pretty wild swinger).<br>
<br>
See you at the picnic, <br>

I am not bringing my 9 year old as she has a birthday party to attend - <br>
she has a love/hate relationship with letterboxing.  Sometimes she's <br>

<br>
The meadow where we are has a large grassy expanse that is fairly flat, <br>
and croquet just might work - we could put it in a corner to minimize <br>
injuries.  Either that or we could make sure that there is some kind of <br>
Purple Heart stamp floating around.<br>

Sounds normal.:) Bookworm only enjoys the clues that are cleverly <br>
written, otherwise can't be bothered. <br>

YUP! Lizardbutt found letterboxing intriging at first, but then the <br>
novelty wore off. I did take the kids boxing in the City recently, <br>
and Lizardbutt enjoyed hunting for them.<br>
