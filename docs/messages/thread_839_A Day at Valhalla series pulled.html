<br>
I just received this missive from the local authorities and will be pulling any boxes that remain on site at the Tallac Historic Estates. Federal Land. I guess he was pretty nice and is just doing his job. The Steamer Tod box was not creating any extra "damage to the landscaping", but that is really beside the point. This is a beautiful site and I am so grateful that we have access to it (it doesn't even close at dusk, as most of the surrounding sites do), and I guess this is a good wake-up call about whether planting boxes in an area is helpful or detrimental. I love the site and wanted to share it. I now need to pick up my boxes, and maybe have a conversation with Ms. Bickenheuser about whether there might be appropriate placements in the vicinity.<br>

We haven't done any in Tahoe as of yet but I bet this was a great place to hide. I do think that the way they went about it was well done and I am glad they held onto them for you to go collect. We will be waiting to see where you plant them next. Hopefully we will be able to find them too.  <br>
