<br/>
I just received this missive from the local authorities and will be pulling any boxes that remain on site at the Tallac Historic Estates. Federal Land. I guess he was pretty nice and is just doing his job. The Steamer Tod box was not creating any extra "damage to the landscaping", but that is really beside the point. This is a beautiful site and I am so grateful that we have access to it (it doesn't even close at dusk, as most of the surrounding sites do), and I guess this is a good wake-up call about whether planting boxes in an area is helpful or detrimental. I love the site and wanted to share it. I now need to pick up my boxes, and maybe have a conversation with Ms. Bickenheuser about whether there might be appropriate placements in the vicinity.<br/>

&gt; Re: Letterboxes Hidden at the Tallac Historic Site, South Lake Tahoe,<br/>
&gt; California<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear artTrekker:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While Tallac Historic Site staff members were conducting routine maintenance,<br/>
&gt; they discovered three of your geocaches/letterboxes hidden at the Site. The<br/>
&gt; Tallac Historic Site includes the Baldwin, Pope, and Valhalla Estates and is<br/>
&gt; located on lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service, Lake Tahoe Basin<br/>
&gt; Management Unit (LTBMU).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While the LTBMU understands geocaching/letterboxing as popular activities, the<br/>
&gt; Forest Service has not yet adopted an official policy regarding these activities<br/>
&gt; on Forest Service administered lands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the meantime, the LTBMU requires that all geocaches/letterboxes be hidden in<br/>
&gt; appropriate areas that do not impact historic buildings, archaeological sites,<br/>
&gt; interpretive displays, landscaping, riparian, wildlife, and/or wilderness areas.<br/>
&gt; Appropriate areas are those that are at least 50 feet from any Forest Service<br/>
&gt; structure, historic structures, archaeological sites, interpretive signs and<br/>
&gt; displays, and near trails that are not located within riparian, wildlife, and/or<br/>
&gt; wilderness areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have had two of your geocaches/letterboxes removed, A Day at Valhalla #1 -<br/>
&gt; Steamer Tod, and A Day at Valhalla #2 - Honeymoon Cabin. The Steamer Tod<br/>
&gt; letterbox was inappropriately placed underneath one of the Tod Goodwin artifacts<br/>
&gt; at the interpretive display. The Honeymoon Cabin letterbox was inappropriately<br/>
&gt; placed in the damaged sill log of the Honeymoon Cabin. The placement of this<br/>
&gt; letterbox, along with the removal and replacement of the letterbox by a number<br/>
&gt; of people, has caused additional damage to the sill log. Also, the location of<br/>
&gt; both of the letterboxes has caused damage to the surrounding landscaping.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you replace the geocaches/letterboxes or hide them in other inappropriate<br/>
&gt; areas, you may be in violation of Title 36 CFR 261 Subpart A 261.9 (a), which<br/>
&gt; prohibits damaging any natural feature or other property of Forest Service<br/>
&gt; administered lands; Title 36 CFR 261 Subpart A 261.9(g), which prohibits digging<br/>
&gt; in, excavating, disturbing, injuring, destroying or in any way damaging any<br/>
&gt; prehistoric, historic, or archaeological resource, structure, site, artifact, or<br/>
&gt; property on Forest Service administered lands; and/or Title 36 CFR 261 Subpart A<br/>
&gt; 261.10 (f), which prohibits abandoning any personal property on Forest Service<br/>
&gt; administered lands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both geocaches/letterboxes can be picked up at the LTBMU�s Supervisor�s Office,<br/>
&gt; 35 College Drive, South Lake Tahoe, California, 96150.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have any questions, please contact Cathy Bickenheuser at (530) 543-2673.<br/>
&gt; She will talk or meet with you and assist in finding an appropriate locations<br/>
&gt; for the geocaches/letterboxes, including virtual geocaches, on Forest Service,<br/>
&gt; LTBMU administered lands.<br/>

We haven't done any in Tahoe as of yet but I bet this was a great place to hide. I do think that the way they went about it was well done and I am glad they held onto them for you to go collect. We will be waiting to see where you plant them next. Hopefully we will be able to find them too.  <br/>
