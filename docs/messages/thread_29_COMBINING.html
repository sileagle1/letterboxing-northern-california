That's kind of my thought as well--I'm all over California and it's <br/>
more convenient for me just to have one board to check rather than <br/>
two.  But I'm willing to conceed to the majority vote.  The ultimate <br/>
talk list would include ALL the areas I letterbox in regularly so it <br/>
would have to include Oregon and Washington as well, but forcing a <br/>
board talored specifically to myself seems kind of selfish.  =)<br/>

<br/>
Well, give it time.  Eventually a major eruption will happen.  =)  If <br/>
you get enough people together for a long enough period of time, <br/>
*eventually* it's going to happen.  But since regional board by their <br/>
nature won't have the number of people as the main talk list, it's <br/>
much less likely to happen.  And even then, the major sticking points <br/>
tend to be national in scope, so they'd be more likely to blow up on <br/>
the main talk list.  But even a regional board won't be completely <br/>
immune of it given more time and members that join up.<br/>

Well, if I only say boxes in California count, that will certainly <br/>
eat into Don &amp; Gwen's total, and they're our strongest players. My <br/>
guess is the Northern California LBers will certainly have outplaced <br/>
we SoCal LBers--not to mention the Central California boxers who, as <br/>
you previously mentioned, would likely side with the Northern half of <br/>
the state--what do you folks have against SoCal?  Is it because we <br/>

Ha!  Southern California has been placing many more boxes and for <br/>
much longer than Northern California.  I'd be very surprised if there <br/>
were more boxes in the north half of the state.  Heck, half the boxes <br/>
in the north were placed by visiting Oregonians.  Spill over from <br/>
Oregon.  Yep, it's true.  =)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Central California definitely got a late start--but wow!  Talk about <br/>
a bloomer!  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; who, as you previously mentioned, would likely side with the<br/>
&gt; Northern half of the state<br/>
<br/>
That's only because I'm from Central California and would rather <br/>
monitor only one talk list than two.  If Central California were <br/>
rolled up with Northern California, then I wouldn't have to monitor <br/>
the Southern California talk list as much.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
But there's also a more practical reason.  If there's to be two talk <br/>
lists, it makes sense to cut the state through the "population <br/>
median" so there would be the same amount of people on each board.  <br/>
Since Southern California has SOOOO many people, throwing in Central <br/>
California with Northern California would help even it out.  =)<br/>

I don't have anything against the Southern Californians at all - it's just totally different <br/>
territory.  You can combine a whole passel of eastern states and still not cover the <br/>
entire georgraphical expanse of California.  I see it more as a regional thing - there <br/>
really aren't that many folks who box in both areas.  Even Seattle and Portland are <br/>
closer together than San Francisco and Los Angeles.  It's not going to break my heart <br/>
if we merge and form an all-Cal list, but I did vote for changing this one into <br/>
primarily N. California.  Most of my 48 boxes are in this part of the state.<br/>

<br/>
But the state population is not what counts, it's the letterboxer <br/>
population, and I'll bet North and Central California have a lot <br/>
more letterboxers.  I can tell you that all of San Diego, Orange and <br/>
Riverside Counties have only 36 letterboxes, and most of these were <br/>
planted by Don &amp; Gwen.  These huge counties probably have no more <br/>
than 6 active letterboxers.<br/>
