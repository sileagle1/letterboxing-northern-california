next weekend?  I'm not sure of the status of our car (I was in an<br/>
accident with a hit and run driver on Wednesday), and want to make<br/>
back up plans.<br/>
<br/>
The tricky part is the wheelchair.  It folds flat, and can fit in a<br/>
trunk, or can go in a car's back seat, it the seat is un-occupied.  it<br/>
isn't covered with grease, although it may get a bit dusty by the end<br/>
of the event.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a lot to ask!<br/>

as we drive through (or very near, anyway) Oakland.  I'll even clean<br/>

Looking forward to the gathering (but still trying to figure out what<br/>
we'll be hiding that is MYSTERIOUS)!<br/>
