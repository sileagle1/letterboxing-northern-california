or whatever it is if I plan on planting a box?  Is there somewhere <br>
special I need to go to get started?  Jeff and I have been <br>
brainstorming and have come up with some LB we want to place but <br>

Posting a webpage is pretty ambitious--you probably just want a place<br>
to distribute clues--which are probably the same places you *find*<br>
clues.  Both letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com allow you to post<br>
clues.  To start on letterboxing.org, from the main page, click on the<br>
link to "Submit Clues" and follow the directions.  On Atlas Quest,<br>
there's a link to "Add Planted Box" under the Letterboxes menu item. <br>
Most of the fields are self-evident, but there's are Help links in the<br>
upper-right corner of the all the pages if you need more information.<br>
<br>
Happy trails!<br>
