                    <div class="plaintext-content">While in the mall last week looking for some letterboxing supplies I noticed<br>
they had two H3 Hummers on display.  Considering this is an outlet mall, gas<br>
is at $3.35/gallon, and these things get 19MPG on the freeway, I was pretty<br>
disgusted.  But it did give a brilliant (I think) idea....<br>
<br>
I'd planted a special Limited Time Only letterbox called Gas Guzzler ON one<br>
of the Hummers!  Plus, I already had the perfect stamp image download to my<br>
desktop. (It's not family friendly, so I won't describe it here, but it<br>
shows what happens to people who buy gas guzzlers like these).<br>
<br>
Well, I did it today and you can find the clues on AQ at<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=14726  This box<br>
will be retired on May 30, 2006 as the mall clerk I spoke with couldn't be<br>
sure the Hummers would be there past Memorial Day.<br>
<br>
While I was there I also planted ANOTHER mall box called Cop Shop.  Clues<br>
for that one are also on AQ at<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=14725<br>
<br>
Planting Cop Shop was tough due to lunchtime traffic (bad timing on my<br>
part), but planting Gas Guzzler was even harder as it turns out these big<br>
"tough" vehicles have almost zero exposed steel!  Almost every part of the<br>
reachable undercarriage (bumpers, wheel wells, etc) is PLASTIC!!<br>
<br>
I hope y'all enjoy finding these boxes as much as I enjoyed planting them,<br>

That reminds me of what Team Green Dragon wrote as their personal<br>
quote on the AQ profile:<br>
<br>
"I'm no evil genius......or are I?"<br>
<br>
Hahahaha!!!! I love it. =)<br>
<br>
Oh, I love the idea for the box too. *nodding*<br>
