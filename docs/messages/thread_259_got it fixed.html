fixed.  I also feel like a total idiot and was receiving e-mail from <br/>
Newboxes to my Aol addy, and these here to Deiselluver.  I really <br/>
want to change this name but Yahoo won't let me.  Anyway it took me <br/>
days to realize I have to look in Yahoo mail.  Duh!!!! I think I <br/>
understand now.  Did our first LB on Sunday..  "WitchyPoo"  had fun.  <br/>
I have Oompa Loompa's and the Alien series lined up for Sunday.  I <br/>
think I have a better understanding now Don so thank you.  In answer <br/>
to your ? yes we are Geocachers and I sure love my hobby.Thats how we <br/>
found out about L-Bing . We are currently at 28 finds and a few <br/>
DNF's. I must say we have been to alot of differnt places and not <br/>
once stumbled on a LB.   Now I do need to find the HH thread cause I <br/>
want to get one, so I need to read more about them.  LOL.  Love my <br/>
Geo Travelbugs.  I have gone online and looked up certain things I <br/>
beleive to be clues to Alien series and we think we know where we are <br/>
going.  Now I just need to investigate other LB and see how they show <br/>
clues.  Sure wish there was a place where you can go that lists just <br/>
the ones in a persons general vicinity, until they become a Veteran <br/>
Letterboxer and can expand there hobby?  <br/>

    Now I just need to investigate other LB and see how they show <br/>
  clues.  Sure wish there was a place where you can go that lists just <br/>
  the ones in a persons general vicinity, until they become a Veteran <br/>
  Letterboxer and can expand there hobby?<br/>
<br/>
  On the LBNA home page<br/>
<br/>
  To check a specific area you have to click on the book, then click on the specific state, then click on a specific area. You will then have a listing of letterboxes by county and city.<br/>
