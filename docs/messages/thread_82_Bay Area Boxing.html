                    <div class="plaintext-content">Amanda was in the Bay Area yesterday so we got in a good day of <br>
boxing.  First we headed up to Marin and got Letterboxing Fools <br>
2 "Miwok Trail" boxes - I couldn't believe that we were the first <br>
finders since the boxes have been there since November.  We also made <br>
it to their Say Cheese! box which had had a bit of traffic.  These <br>
two can easily be done together as Novato Blvd. connects them.<br>
<br>
Next we did box maintenance on Oompa Loompa which is alive and well, <br>
and have only one mosquito bite to show for my efforts - they were <br>
definitely swarming!  <br>
<br>
Then we had to pick up SleepyCat and headed to Berkeley where we did <br>
box maintenance on Haunted Carousel and Pony Rides (inthe Tilden Pakr <br>
series) and found the Little Fish in a Big Pond box.  Nice succint <br>
clues which we were happy to interpret correctly.  <br>
<br>
The biggest news is that Amanda found her 800th box!  Woo Hoo!  <br>
Pictures were taken to commemorate the event.<br>
