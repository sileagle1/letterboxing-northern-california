<br/>
I spent eight summers working at an opera company in rural upstate <br/>
New York, and while I was there, I seeded the area with letterboxes, <br/>
and got my house mate Erica into the game.<br/>
<br/>
Then Robb had his accident, and I stopped leaving him over the <br/>
summers.  Erica got a new house mate at the farmhouse, who happened <br/>
to have been an occasional employee at Berkeley Rep, where I work.<br/>
<br/>
Erica got Linda (the new house mate) into letterboxing, and since <br/>
Linda works at Yale in New Haven Connecticut, there are loads of <br/>
letterboxing opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
So now, Linda and her husband are visiting family in the Bay Area <br/>
with a new baby in tow, and they want to go letterboxing with me.<br/>
<br/>
**********************************************************<br/>
<br/>
So, what I'm wondering is what would be the location with the most <br/>
potential for happy successful finds?  We're getting together late <br/>
afternoon tomorrow either in West Oakland, or near Lake Merritt, and <br/>
they're going to have the kidlet in a backpack.  I don't want to <br/>
lead them on a wild-goose chase, or go on a hike that will end after <br/>
the sun goes down, or is too strenuous for new parents.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
Though a couple of the boxes are missing, I'd recommend doing the<br/>
Through the Looking Glass series at Lake Merritt. You wouldn't have to<br/>
travel far, and it is a nice walk around the lake.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to recommend  Denise Row's "And They're off" because it is<br/>
a cool stamp and it's not too too far (near the other side of the bay<br/>
trail), but it looks like it is missing. That's a shame because I<br/>
loved that stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Have a good time!<br/>
