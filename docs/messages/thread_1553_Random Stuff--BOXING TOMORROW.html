you got the job in Portland? If so, LUCKY dogs! I mean on both sides,<br>
'cuz there are a HECK of a lot of letterboxes up there with the<br>
heck-a-lotta letterbox-ers you might assume go aloing with them but<br>
THEY are going to be the fortunate ones, getting you both as 'boxers,<br>
event planners and, in general, very fun people. <br>

<br>
I WISH there was a guaranteed job up there.  I'll be working my tush<br>
off up there next week, trying to nail down something, but ah, life is<br>
exciting when one has no firm plans.<br>
<br>
We're still around for a month or so.  IN FACT, this leads me to my<br>
next announcement.  We're going up to check on Shipyard Shirley and<br>
then were going to nab Doublesaj and Old Blue's new Sins series. <br>
Anybody wanna come?  Drop a line/email.  my cell is 408.717.3960  <br>
