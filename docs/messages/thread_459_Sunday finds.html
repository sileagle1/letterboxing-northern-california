Hi everyone Happy New Year again.. Today Jeff and I set out, once <br/>
again not until noon... :(  Seems we can never get a early start!!! <br/>
We went and found  Holy Canoli.  Oh what a treat.  We loved <br/>
it...Mimulus.... Do you live close or have a friend who lives <br/>
close????? Glad for the Digital camera.  Took us a bit of time to <br/>
locate but it was well worth it.  <br/>
Next we went and did 3 Geocaches.  Found 2.  The third was gone I <br/>
think.  Then off to do American Graffiti.  Found 2 out of 3 Wascally <br/>
because I didn't bother to read last night that we had only till 5pm <br/>
for #3.  :( So the Ranger kicked us out before we ever parked the <br/>
car.  So we will go back soon because we want to do the 2 Birds and <br/>
that one.  We did enjoy them though.  Gotta tell you that there is <br/>
supposed to be a Hybrid at the same exact place for #1.  I believe it <br/>
is still there.  When I am done here I plan to check that one and see <br/>
when the last time was it was found. Will let you know off list.   I <br/>
looked but didn't find it.  I did however in the AG box #1 find the <br/>
Ca Quail HH.  Going to wait now till we go back out again to place <br/>
it.  So it will spend a little time with us.  :)  I was so <br/>
excited ...our first HH.. Then Mimulus it was off to do Brine <br/>
Country... In the dark.  We didn't find it.  :(  How dissapointing.  <br/>
I swear we had the rusty one.... SO we finally headed back,    So <br/>
total  3 LB 1 HH and 2 Geo's.  Not bad for us old people....Till next <br/>
time  and Thanks to both of you for a fun day. "BootZoo Crew"<br/>

I set Calif Quail HH loose so I'm glad to hear it's still ok. Is the  <br/>
book/paper full?  <br/>
