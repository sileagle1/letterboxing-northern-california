<br/>
It is a low impact hitch hiker. When you find it, I don't want you to<br/>
curse the letterboxing heavens that you found another *^$%@ hitch<br/>
hiker; there is no accompanying logbook, and no obligation to stamp<br/>
all over the place. Just stamp, date (or not), and leave it. Don't<br/>
worry about writing that you left it, or writing any little notes, or<br/>
anything. Hitch hikers are supposed to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
To make it more fun, the Bay Area Bug is for the San Francisco Bay<br/>
Area only. This way, we'll see its little stamp all over. The exact<br/>
range for the Bay Area Bug is up for debate. I kind of had it imagined<br/>
as anywhere in the LBNCA area, which is bascially northern California.<br/>
There are plenty of boxes to keep it busy for a long time!<br/>
<br/>
If you have it, and it's too big to fit into a letterbox, stamp it in<br/>
anyway just to have it say hi (or not)! <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see it moving around!<br/>
