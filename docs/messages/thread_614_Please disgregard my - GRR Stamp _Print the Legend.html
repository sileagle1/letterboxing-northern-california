                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, let's try this again.  Some of you will probably have received my 2<br/>
previous messages that include the answers to Mimulus' Print the Legend<br/>
box.  Sorry for being an email dork &amp; sending them out.  I've deleted<br/>
the messages off the group &amp; I hope that deletes them for everyone.  But<br/>
the people that are signed up for the group's individual emails to be<br/>
delivered will probably still get it.  Please delete my emails &amp; don't<br/>
look at the answers.  I'm so sorry for messing up like that.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, for some useful news, for those of you around<br/>
Sacramento, the downtown library has 2 copies if the Man Who Shot<br/>
Liberty Valence.  I should be returning my copy in the next day or 2.<br/>
You can request a copy to be transferred to your local library to check<br/>
out &amp; not have to come all the way downtown to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry again,<br/>
Dork Cavalier<br/>
