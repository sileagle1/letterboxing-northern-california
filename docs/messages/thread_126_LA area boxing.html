                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey there, I was in LA on the 12th and did some letterboxing. Got <br/>
Agriscapes by Sierra Sally! Very clever hiding place.<br/>
And I got the Strange Stamps at Heritage Park in Santa Fe Springs I <br/>
highly reccommend this park and letterbox series. It was very <br/>
interesting and education and a quite easy walk.<br/>
<br/>
I also got a couple of letterboxes in Whittier by Jam and Jelly <br/>
and I went by the Easter Bunny in Fullerton, the log book was full <br/>
and I didn't have a replacement with me, but I did leave some blank <br/>
paper inside for future stamping and I will try to get back and leave <br/>
a new book ASAP.--Also picked up the Flying through the Air HH and am <br/>
flying it back to Seattle tomorrow!<br/>
