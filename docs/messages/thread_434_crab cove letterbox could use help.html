<br/>
If anyone is going out to the Crab Cove letterbox, where we ventured today<br/>
(as well as to Sushi House - both were very cool to find) - bring an extra<br/>
plastic bag. Water seeped into the box and into both plastic bags. By some<br/>
fluke, the book was completely dry. We dried out everything and packed well,<br/>
but there was no outside plastic bag for the box itself. Unfortunately, it<br/>
didn't work out for us to go get one and bring it back....<br/>
<br/>
We looked for the geocache/letterbox hybrid that's planted nearby but didn't<br/>
find it, possibly because the young one was too cold to keep trying, or<br/>
perhaps because it's no longer there.... One of the clues has (I think)<br/>
changed as there's been landscaping. If anyone knows anything more about<br/>
this, let me know so we can try it another time.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for contributing to this extra enticement for my family for<br/>
going out - even on a rainy day!<br/>
