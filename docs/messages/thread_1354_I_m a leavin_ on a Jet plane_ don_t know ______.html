Won't you all be so jealous of me!??!?   It's quite a shame since I just read The Hound of the <br/>
Baskervilles recently and visited Dartmoor, the scene of the events, and would hope to give <br/>
you all a run for your money in any trivia contests about the story.  Furthermore, I just <br/>
submitted an article to the Nancy Drew fanzine The Sleuth about the similarities between <br/>
The Hound of the Baskervilles and one of Nancy's adventures (#150 the Mystery at <br/>
Moorsea Manor, in case anyone other than Amanda is remotely interested).<br/>
