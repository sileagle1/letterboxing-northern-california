as any.  Plus it was my birthday.  aT's gettign out of Dodge post left <br/>
me no alternative but to pack up and go.  I found:<br/>
<br/>
Hawkhill<br/>
Golden Gate Bridge<br/>
The Therapeutist<br/>
Ortus<br/>
San Francisco Church (great camo job, da Kool Kats!)<br/>
<br/>
I also checked on my Tarts box which I have not seen since the last <br/>
gathering in 2004.  Alive and well.  Of course I had ambitions to get <br/>
more but not enough time.....Ben and I had to spend several hours at <br/>
the Exploratorium exploring.  And the other boxes where in such <br/>
interesting places we had to linger there too.<br/>
<br/>
I get to celebrate again with Steve and Ben when it is my choice to go <br/>
do something over the weekend...and I think it will be to go LBing in <br/>
the city to go for those wind gods....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Paul and WELCOME back!<br/>
