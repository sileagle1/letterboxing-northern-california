been found by Aahz (San Jose) and Lea (Oakland).  I recall waiting <br/>
what seemed like an eternity for my very first letterbox to be <br/>
discovered. <br/>

I fear that I forgot to archive the message from Bandaid that had her <br/>
mobile phone number.  I've written her, and hope she'll have time to <br/>
respond before she travels.  She and I never really "firmed up" our <br/>
plans, although she's VERY excited about meetng y'all.<br/>

We know what hotel she's staying at in S.F. Why don't we call  there if we <br/>
can't find her phone number?   <br/>
