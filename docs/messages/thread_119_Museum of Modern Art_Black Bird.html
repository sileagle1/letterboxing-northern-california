                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had Amanda from Seattle walk the Museum of Modern Art route with me <br>
last week and determined that the clues for Skrik needed some <br>
revisions.  So I have changed them around, plus recarved and replanted <br>
The Son of Man.  The original box was destroyed by wild bunnies that <br>
inhabit the area.  Every time I go back to that spot, it seems like <br>
there are more bunnies  than last time.......<br>
<br>
Also, The Black Bird is confirmed missing.  I have recarved it and will <br>
replant, but probably in a slightly different spot.<br>
<br>
I don't know when I'll be able to get into San Francisco to get Paul's <br>
new Nepenthe box, so I'm throwing down the gauntlet to you other local <br>
letterboxers - see if you can beat me to it!<br>
