the others left over from GRR when we go to Old Town.  I'll check them<br/>
too next time we're down there.<br/>
<br/>
I did also get an update on my Eureka box in the little garden area.<br/>
Apparently the brewery in the clue has closed &amp; there's construction in<br/>
that area.  The boxer wasn't able to find the pillar it was supposed to<br/>
be under, so both mine &amp; artTrekker's might be gone now.<br/>
