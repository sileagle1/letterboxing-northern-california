Great to see that our own amazingly motivated Princess Lea has already<br>
found the Cicada letterbox, even if NOBODY has attempted the San<br>
Leandro  letterbox.  (hint....hint....)<br>
<br>
I love the idea of Boxin' by the Side of the Bay.  Otis Redding is<br>
stuck in my head...the whistling part in particular.<br>
<br>
I think that new York State has finally dried out from the horrible<br>
flooding of a few weeks ago, because I'm getting "found" reports from<br>
my Cooperstown area letterboxes.  <br>

less than deciphered clue with me. Since it was such a lame "attempt" I<br>
couldn't bring myself to list it.  I'll be out there again, though.  And,<br>
for any of you frisbee golfers out there, I was told this park is a great<br>
place to play!<br>
