have temporarily removed the box for safe-keeping.  The footbridge is<br/>
undergoing repair, and the surrounding area turned into a pedestrian<br/>
walkway.  So, this very busy box will be out of commission for a<br/>
period of time.  As it was, I had to reach through the bars of the<br/>
bridge to retrieve this since both sides were closed off!<br/>
<br/>
I will replace it as soon as possible.  It looks like I'll need to put<br/>
in a new logbook!  A busy spot this is!<br/>
