I went back to Middle Harbor Shoreline Park on Sunday, and noticed<br/>
that Palm Trees Equal Camels, Right? had gotten really soggy because<br/>
the ziplock container hadn't been fully sealed.  I wasn't happy with<br/>
that container, and was planning on replacing it.  I wanted to have<br/>
the apperture/opening pointing down, so that it wasn't a gaping maw<br/>
for water.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was very taken my these tiny baggies, and wondered if I<br/>
could incorporate them into my bag.<br/>
<br/>
I'm keeping the camoflage, in any case!<br/>

Glad to hear Palm Trees was still there... love that stamp and was hoping<br/>
it wouldn't disappear. :)<br/>

Royalbag.com sells bags in various sizes that are much sturdier (I <br/>
like the 6-mil thickness) than the bags you get at the grocery or <br/>
craft store. I just bought several hundred in various sizes which <br/>
will last me a while.<br/>
