<br/>
I live in Wisconsin and will be visiting the San Francisco area next <br/>
weekend.  I am hoping to find a few boxes while I am there.  Can any of <br/>
you suggest good boxes to go to, or even boxes that are confirmed still <br/>
there?  Any tips would be much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

Two of our favorites that we're gotten just recently and know they are<br/>
in place are Playland Lives.  Beautiful area, mentally challenging and<br/>
great stamp and Star Crossed for the same reasons, although you are<br/>
doubly challenged with Star Crossed due to all of the foot traffic. <br/>
You have to be very clever to retrieve this box, without being<br/>
obvious, which adds to the thrill.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are still 4 of the 5 boxes of The Message in the Haunted<br/>
Mansion.  These are nice stamps and there is a link at the end of<br/>
these clues to an additional box at one of the most interesting places<br/>
I've been to get a stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you'll get a lot of other suggestions, which I will be<br/>
watching for, as well.  We hope to be over there in a few weeks<br/>
ourselves, so will take advantage of the suggestions.<br/>

Hope you enjoy your stay in SF.<br/>

County), not San Francisco. However, they are on the other side of the<br/>
Golden Gate Bridge and they overlook the bridge. There are fabulous sweeping<br/>
views of the city and Bridge from the location of the box. I would recommend<br/>
it and you won't be the only tourist there...it is popular.<br/>
-Bonedoc<br/>
Ps. They are also both pretty quick and easy to find. <br/>

Other boxes not in GGP are Greener Pastures, Dirty Harry and the <br/>

Don't forget the hybrid letterbox/geocache "Columba" (clues are<br/>
listed <br/>
at www.geocaching.com, no need for GPS device, just find the location <br/>
and follow the clues).  Still there as of a week ago.  Hours are <br/>
limited for access, but it's a neat place.  There is apparently a<br/>
brand <br/>
new box also listed on letterboxing.org in the same location placed<br/>
by <br/>
Chantt, so it would be a two for one type of deal.<br/>
<br/>
We did the Lands End series about two months ago--a fabulous hike<br/>
with <br/>
spectacular views of GG Bridge.  We found boxes 1 and 3, didn't find <br/>
#2. Easy hike but with stairs--don't try it with a stroller, is my <br/>
advice from personal experience.<br/>
