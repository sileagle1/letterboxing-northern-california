you have already. It is my pleasure to be a small part of your <br/>
honorable endeavors.<br/>
<br/>
In response to your question, am most disappointed to tell you that I <br/>
will be unable to come to this gathering as I will be attending to <br/>
some important business. I would say if there was some token you wish <br/>
to bestow upon me, you could give it to the intrepid and honorable <br/>
ArtTrekker, however, it is my understanding that she too will be <br/>
attending to important business. In my attempt to be discrete about <br/>
my identity, you might wonder why I don't just obtain a postal box in <br/>
the town I frequent. Unfortunately, upon entry to any post office, <br/>
you may notice images on display which bear uncanny resemblance to my <br/>
outward appearance.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we shall meet at some future event. . . or some past event.<br/>
<br/>
Your Most Humble Servant<br/>
OBJuan<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Did you receive my email concerning the proposed joint venture?<br/>
