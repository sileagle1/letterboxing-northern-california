I had to pull "The Jungle Inn" Hithchhiker hostel from it's location<br>
yesterday. I will replace it in the same spot next month. The Marin County<br>
Fair takes place every year here for the Fourth of July and I see that they<br>
are already starting to get set up. Hoards of people will be there soon so I<br>
had to do it before it got crazy. When everyone has cleared out of there I<br>
will replace it and let you know. <br>
