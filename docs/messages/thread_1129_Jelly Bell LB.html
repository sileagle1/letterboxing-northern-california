Well Anna just wrote me that she could not find it recently, but it has <br>
been "missing" before but later found intact, so I am never really sure <br>
if it is REALLY gone or not.  Right now I have it listed as active.  I <br>
have gone so far as to recarve a new stamp, but then Don & Gwen <br>
reported it found, so I never had to go to replant.  Let's just say it <br>
is VERY well hidden.<br>

P.S.  the weekend of June 9th is really bad for me, but I would imagine <br>
Buppster will have her hands full with the graduation anyway - if the <br>
following week is what we are aiming for, I am game, although Mondays <br>
are out for me<br>
