Thank you GG for the nice words about our Tribal Falls Letterbox.  It <br>
was recently recarved and replaced.  The first one disappeared.  As <br>
you know, this is not a box for the "faint of heart."  It's an <br>
adventure!<br>
Perhaps, this would have been an ideal box to make a WOM only box.  It <br>
may have generated a few more visits this way.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to note that 4 of the 6 finds and attempts were by <br>
the "older" boxers.  <br>
<br>
We've just returned from 5 days and 6 nights in downtown BLYTHE.  Yes, <br>
Blythe!  Actually, it wasn't too bad.  Just very hot.  They had a big <br>
rain Monday night and Tuesday (very unusual).  They got just about <br>
half of their annual rainfall in that time period and then yesterday <br>
was as humid as MS!  <br>
<br>
We placed a box while there, but I don't forsee it getting many <br>
visits.  <br>
<br>
It's good to be home.<br>
