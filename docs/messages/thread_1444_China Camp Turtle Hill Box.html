We went looking for it Saturday and had a nice hike but came away <br/>
boxless. Wonder if we flubbed the clues (I doubt it) or if the box is <br/>
gone. I sent a note to the placer via the LBNA site but haven't heard <br/>
anything. We were thinking to go for #2 in the series but wonder if <br/>
the rangers may have nabbed them. I'm new to letterboxing but I assume <br/>
that happens sometimes, or maybe just vandals. Wondered if anyone else <br/>
had seen it, thanks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found both the China Camp boxes last year.  The Turtle Hill is very <br/>
specific about what to look for and which path to take - make sure you <br/>
get that right (we almost missed it!).  Honour of the Boxalots got it <br/>
right and we found it pretty easily after that. <br/>
Find someone who thinks beyond the box when you letterbox - What you <br/>
don't think of, they do, and you will always log a find!<br/>

(Kudos to the Boxalots!!!!!  NoCal misses you!  Enjoy DC while you can!)<br/>
