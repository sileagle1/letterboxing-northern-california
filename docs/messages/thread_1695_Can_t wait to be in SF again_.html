                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will be back in San Francisco (in Nob Hill this time) for a <br/>
conference the last weekend of September.  I need to come out early and <br/>
get a few things done, but I will probably have September 24 and 25 at <br/>
least somewhat free.  It might be somewhat unlikely, since it would be <br/>
the middle of the week and all, but is anyone free for some boxing?  I <br/>
would really love to meet up at the zoo, where I have noticed a number <br/>
of new and fun looking boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If not, I hope that I can work out something with some of you guys!  <br/>
There is also a GREAT sushi place by my hotel called Wayo Sushi, so if <br/>
the zoo doesn't work out, we could always do some sushi and stamping.  <br/>
There's still plenty of time before my trip this time, but feel free to <br/>
shoot me an e-mail (aeckert1@yahoo.com) or you can AQ mail me <br/>
(allemeyn) as well.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you guys are enjoying your summer and that nobody is too close to <br/>
all the fires.<br/>
