It definitely sounds like you all had a great mini-gathering!  We were thinking about you all as we were airborne on our trip home to northern Louisiana....a place that is sadly devoid of letter boxes.  We have brought a small assortment of carving materials and are going to attempt our first placements in hopes of seeding the area!  We'll see.  Probably would have been nice to get the demo on Sunday....hopefully we won't embarrass the sport too much with our attempts!<br/>
<br/>
We are looking forward to the Spring Gathering.  Please let us know how we can help.  We want to put some faces with these names as well.<br/>
<br/>
And...if we had been there we could have rounded out your PFX to 500. Shucks!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the tips and shared info - I appreciate this group!<br/>
<br/>
Hope GrumpyGrinch is feeling better soon!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays to you all - Take care, BugZ<br/>
