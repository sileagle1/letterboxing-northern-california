curiosities, and whatnot, I discovered that part of the design idea of <br/>
the first show of the season at Berkeley Rep will be this very thing.<br/>
<br/>
How delightfully odd.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatley, I may not be dong a lot of the carving of fake exotic <br/>
animals.  I'll probably just be painting walls and floors....<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, it is inspiring to look at the research!<br/>

Curiosties!"<br/>

The store that will eventually host the 1st box has copies of that <br/>
book for sale. I'm working from Ernst Haekel's "Art Forms in Nature". <br/>
for the stamps, because I own a copy.<br/>
<br/>
This 1st box is ready, but I wasn't able to talk to the store owner <br/>
yet. Since I'm visiting a friend in Denver this week, planting #1 will <br/>
wait until the following week.<br/>
<br/>
Since this box is hosted, I made the presentation more elaborate, and <br/>
it involved an artsy handmade logbook, a tapestry fabric case with a <br/>
polymer clay button, and of course, a jumbo stamp. <br/>
