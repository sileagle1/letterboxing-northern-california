<br/>
It's been ages since I last posted to this group! I have a request for anyone who may be able to help...<br/>
<br/>
Back in Oct '03 we released a Hitchhiker at the SLO gathering, the Halloween Witch ( I think Doublesaj, Princes Lea and a couple others stamped in before the Buzzard placed the HH near LA in early '04. We received an email in early '05 from Modern Dulcinea saying she found the HH in pieces near the site of Buzzards vandalized box, but would put it back together and rerelease it.<br/>
<br/>
And that's where the story ends - until Jan 10, when I got an email from a geocacher saying the HH had been sitting in a cache called "Change Is Good" in Dublin CA all this time! <br/>
<br/>
I'd really like to get this HH back into the letterboxing world - The 'cacher is near Concord and seems to be willing to put the HH in a cache "hostel" or some such thing.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone local to that area that may be able to meet this fellow and get the HH?<br/>
<br/>
You can reply offlist as well as here<br/>
