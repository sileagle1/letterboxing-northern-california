your knowledge of Greek mythology in a hunt for Nepenthe, the <br>
mythical potion that induces forgetfulness of sorrow and grief. <br>
<br>
It has been an immensely popular letterbox, and I've received my <br>
heartfelt thanks for planting it from letterboxers who appreciated <br>
both the mythology puzzle and the location of the letterbox.<br>
<br>
Some time ago, it was geotrashed, due to its extreme proximity to a <br>
geocache. I've now moved it further away, and we'll give Nepenthe <br>
another life.<br>
<br>
I have a personal connection with the idea of nepenthe, so this box <br>
means a lot to me. Those finding the box, and curious about my <br>
connection, may e-mail me, and I'll send the story to you, along <br>
with accompanying music, if desired.<br>
<br>
Some recent reading I've done indicates that there may well have <br>
been a real potion known as nepenthe, and that it was an opium <br>
derivative.<br>
<br>
Nepethe clues are at: http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/nepenthe.htm<br>
<br>
Enjoy a dose of Nepenthe!<br>
