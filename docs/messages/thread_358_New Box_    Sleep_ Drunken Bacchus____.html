SO, you all probably thought I vanished into a different psychic <br>
dimension, since my letterboxing activities have diminished <br>
(temporarily, at least). But here I am again, with another newly <br>
planted letterbox. <br>
<br>
Sleep,Drunken Bacchus...! is part of the Wine Country invitational <br>
series and the link, for now, is: <br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?<br>
boxnum=12210&boxname=Sleep,_Drunken_Bacchus...<br>
I'll reformat the clues into a web page that I'll host, later.<br>
<br>
This letterbox has a hinged stamp, much like Star-Crossed. Both of <br>
the stamps have images derived from oil paintings. Star-Crossed is <br>
from a painting by the Spanish painter, Murillo, and Caravaggio's <br>
painting of a youthful Bacchus is what I worked from for this stamp. <br>
I carved both stamps at roughly the same time. <br>
<br>
Working from prints of paintings (and not from clip art) requires <br>
breaking down the full range of color values in the painting into the <br>
solid black-and-white areas needed to carve from. I create the <br>
stamp's artwork by using my eyes, a 3B pencil, tracing  and grid <br>
papers, and squinting at times to help decide whether a value in an <br>
area becomes black or not. There are always ambiguous areas that you <br>
need to fake a bit and re-work. <br>
<br>
There isn't a shortcut to sort and translate the colors that I'm <br>
aware of, other than scanning and using Photoshop's "Stamp" filter, <br>
which wouldn't give the same look. I think Photoshop works well for <br>
photos, but paintings generally don't strive for the precise <br>
verisimilitude that photos have. [Hey! Get the dictionary instead of <br>
ignoring that big word!].<br>
<br>
Has anyone else worked from prints of paintings? What method do you <br>
use? Any shortcuts?<br>
<br>
Some day, I may work out how to hinge stamps to have more than 1 <br>
fold, and with more than 1 brace...     <br>
[then hide the boxes underwater, with word-y narrative-style trivia <br>
word puzzle clues in a weird font, using a character substitution-<br>
based code that'll require a deciphering device puzzle ... JUST <br>
KIDDING, FOLKS!]<br>
<br>
Oh, and BTW, in the spirit of Nepenthe, let me make certain that <br>
everyone knows that Bacchus is a Roman god, and not a Greek god... <br>
but he does reside within sight of a certain Greek goddess'letterbox, <br>
and she's part of the Wine Country series, too!<br>

All I can say is WOW! And I can't wait to find these<br>
boxes and check out the stamps.<br>
