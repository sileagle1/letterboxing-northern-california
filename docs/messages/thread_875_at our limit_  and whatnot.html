huge mound of styrofoam (and looking like I'm carving in a blizzard),<br/>
but I noticed that Yahoo says we're almost at our limit for picture<br/>
storage.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if our beloved moderators might take a gander at our<br/>
pictures, and let us know which ones might need to be re-sized?  <br/>

Kel -- by relief printing, I mean woodlock printing, linocuts,<br/>
collograph (that's inking up a collage for those who don't happen to<br/>
have been a big geek like me, and studied art history), and of course<br/>
eraser carving.  I guess the big difference between these and intaglio<br/>
(etching) is that the ink sit on the high spots on a relief block, and<br/>
in etching, you wipe the plate, so that the ink stays only in the low<br/>
spots.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I was holding forth like some kind of stinkin' expert, I decided<br/>
to follow my own durn advice, and headed down to the public library. <br/>
I have a few new favorites in the world of relief printing.<br/>

Yeah, Yahoo only allows 30 megabytes for photos--a piddling amount<br/>
considering some of the photos uploaded for the GRR gathering were<br/>
over two megabytes each in size.<br/>
<br/>
I've copied all of those photos to Atlas Quest and deleted them from<br/>
here to make more room. Lots of room now! But please, any photos you<br/>
upload here, make sure they aren't more than 50K or so. These<br/>
two-megabyte files mean there's only room for 15 photos!<br/>
<br/>
If you're not inclined to shrink photos before uploading them here, AQ<br/>
will do that automatically for photos there so size isn't an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, there's plenty of extra room here now. =)<br/>
