place a letterbox near where we live." They called me crazy! They said, "Don't <br/>
you know? San Mateo County can't hold more than one letterbox! It's <br/>
impossible!" We set out to prove them wrong. And prove them wrong we did!<br/>
<br/>
Finally!! After so many months of looking at our little erasers and stamp pads, <br/>
we managed to plant a box. It's Get to the Point at Coyote Point Park in San <br/>
Mateo. Can we use two kids under two as our excuse?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we're also halfway through carving a series that we'll plant all around <br/>
San Mateo County in the next month or so, so come on down!<br/>

BRAVO! Within striking distance of SF, no less! Keep at it. Can't <br/>
have too many boxes!<br/>
