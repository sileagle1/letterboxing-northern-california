Alrighty then!  <br>
<br>
December 19th it is, Please email me for directions if you are <br>
interested in attending.  My school administrators have asked <br>
that I don't do a general post of the location, address, etc.  But it <br>
is easy to find and I will give you all you need to know to get here.<br>
<br>
I have lino tools for folks to use if they want, I'm not sure how it <br>
will work, you'll probably want to bring your own supplies, but I <br>
have extras just in case.<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to meeting you all.<br>

Wish we could attend.  Grumpy and I would love to meet some of our <br>
fellow California letterboxers, and learn some new carving <br>
techniques.  Since it is my birthday on the 19th, I suspect children <br>
and grandchildren will require our presence elsewhere.  Have a <br>
wonderful time together.<br>

Actually, we who love her are just a little concerned about leaving <br>
her with a combination of sharp objects and unfettered <br>
letterboxers...:)<br>

I'd love to come to the carving workshop-- been boxing<br>
since 8/04 and LOVING it!!!  I'd love to get some help<br>
with stampmaking skills and have a chance to meet<br>
fellow boxers.<br>
