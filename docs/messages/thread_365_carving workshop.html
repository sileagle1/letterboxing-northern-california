Alrighty then!  <br/>
<br/>
December 19th it is, Please email me for directions if you are <br/>
interested in attending.  My school administrators have asked <br/>
that I don't do a general post of the location, address, etc.  But it <br/>
is easy to find and I will give you all you need to know to get here.<br/>
<br/>
I have lino tools for folks to use if they want, I'm not sure how it <br/>
will work, you'll probably want to bring your own supplies, but I <br/>
have extras just in case.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to meeting you all.<br/>

Wish we could attend.  Grumpy and I would love to meet some of our <br/>
fellow California letterboxers, and learn some new carving <br/>
techniques.  Since it is my birthday on the 19th, I suspect children <br/>
and grandchildren will require our presence elsewhere.  Have a <br/>
wonderful time together.<br/>

Actually, we who love her are just a little concerned about leaving <br/>
her with a combination of sharp objects and unfettered <br/>
letterboxers...:)<br/>

Hi--<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for hosting this event!!<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to come to the carving workshop-- been boxing<br/>
since 8/04 and LOVING it!!!  I'd love to get some help<br/>
with stampmaking skills and have a chance to meet<br/>
fellow boxers.<br/>
<br/>
May I have directions?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
