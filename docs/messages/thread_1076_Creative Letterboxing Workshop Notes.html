"challenge" from a jar &amp; come up with as many ideas as we can on how to<br/>
implement it.  The challenges I remember were:<br/>
<br/>
Design a letterbox that specifically seeks out its recipient, &amp; then<br/>
moves on to the next letterboxer.<br/>
Design a letterbox that plays a prank on the finder.<br/>
Design a letterbox that raises money for charity.<br/>
Design a letterbox that "indoctrinates" young children (2-6 yr old) to<br/>
the hobby.<br/>
(One more I can't remember)<br/>
<br/>
The 2nd challenge I was part of was to "Create ways to distribute clues<br/>
that haven't been used before".<br/>
<br/>
Here's what we came up with:<br/>
<br/>
Personal Ad in the newspaper<br/>
Bathroom Graffiti<br/>
Slip a piece of paper into a book, maybe a library book about England &amp;<br/>
put it on the page with a reference to Dartmoor<br/>
Random Mailings<br/>
Post on public bulletin boards<br/>
Put together a basic letterbox &amp; leave it in the open in a public place.<br/>
It would also include an explanation of the hobby &amp; clues to another box<br/>
Read the clues at a spoken word poetry reading<br/>
Put your clues in a fortune cookie<br/>
Billboard<br/>
Bumper Stickers<br/>
Skywriting<br/>
T-shirts<br/>
Embed clues either in your own person stamp or logbook, a box's stamp or<br/>
logbook<br/>
<br/>
We know that most of these could not really be targeted to boxers<br/>
specifically, but instead would be sent out to the general populace,<br/>
which brings up a whole other issue.  But, the challenge didn't specify<br/>
the distribution had to go to boxers.<br/>
