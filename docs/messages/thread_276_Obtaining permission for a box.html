This is an etiquette question.  I have been wanting to place a box at <br/>
the Exploratorium for several months now.  I have tried four times<br/>
via <br/>
various avenues to ask permission...an initial email to 2 different <br/>
staff.  NO answer.  Then I went to the office and spoke to a <br/>
receptionist (Who has been to Dartmoor and thought it a great idea.)  <br/>
She had no authority so took a note and promised to pass it someone <br/>
who did...but no word for a month after that.<br/>
<br/>
SO I went back to the office, spoke to a different person who gave me <br/>
the phone nummber of the public relations person whom I actually<br/>
spoke <br/>
to... and she referred me to someone else who never answered my voice <br/>
message.  <br/>
<br/>
OK...now I just want to place a box there and run the risk it will be <br/>
removed by management.  OR should I just forget about it and put my <br/>
energies elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
I would love feedback from people.  This box would most defintiely be <br/>
inside the building.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We generally ask forgiveness rather than permission. That being said you might want to plant the letterbox, print the clues and deliver the clues to the person in charge if you really want to have their permission. That course of action may result in removal, but it may lead to official acceptance. Long after we planted our Long Beach State series I had an occasion to advise the President Bob Maxon and told him specifically what we had done. In typical political mode he just grinned and thanked me for our support of the university(we had donated funds to the athletic program). I'm not sure there was total comprehension, but he was told, and the letterboxes remain.<br/>
