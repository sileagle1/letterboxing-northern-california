<br/>
We had a great visit with the folks in Redding, and did some <br/>
boxing "damage" while there. To wit:<br/>
<br/>
- Added both the Ide Adobe and FunHog Lake Plateau stamps to our <br/>
logbook collection. I hadn't been to the Ide Adobe since I was a <br/>
schoolkid, and it's changed a lot! What a terrific hiding place. <br/>
(Anyone attempting FunHog Lake Plateau can earn extra brownie points <br/>
if they find the camera case Mom appears to have dropped...) FunHog, <br/>
the Plateau box is soon going to run out of pages, after seeing more <br/>
traffic than the Adobe.<br/>
<br/>
-  Spent a day out Whiskeytown way, and hiked into Chrystal Creek. <br/>
The box itself appeared to be missing, but wow, what a beatiful spot. <br/>
Even my Mom, Maven of all things Shasta County, didn't know about <br/>
this place! (In all fairness, it's been closed many years because of <br/>
the work camp up the road, now closed.) <br/>
<br/>
- Took the spare time freed up by someone else cooking to carve and <br/>
place two of my own about and not about town. Haven't been able to <br/>
get the LbNA site to cooperate in letting me post, so y'all may have <br/>
to wait a bit.<br/>
<br/>
- Dammed Shasta is fine, and they've resumed tours at the dam again. <br/>
The tour is great on a hot day, as it's 65 degrees inside.<br/>
<br/>
Celt et al.<br/>
