CONGRATS! Princess Lea...cerumen (ear wax) looks like reddish orange<br/>
eroded rocks thru an otoscope....maybe like what the mars rover sees<br/>
lookign at mars landscape.  Definitley go for the stethoscope.  I am<br/>
so glad you have finished your degree and now have more time for<br/>
LBing..and in Dartmoor no less!<br/>
<br/>
I am sad to say I am also going to miss the event tomorrow due to my<br/>
son's birthday party.  I hope Paul will find time to make his generous<br/>
offer again and teach the calss a second time. The whole world needs<br/>
more out of the box thinkers.  <br/>
