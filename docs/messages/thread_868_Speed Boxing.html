                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, I know I should be thinking about Katrina and its aftermath, but <br/>
I need to give it a rest and do something mindless.  Well, not <br/>
exactly mindless but I did escape reality via reading "Blink" by <br/>
Malcom Gladwell.  Subtitled: The Power of Thinking without Thinking. <br/>
He wrote the Tipping Point, too.  Both NY TImes bestsellers.  <br/>
Anyway, he talks about speed dating....you spend five minutes a <br/>
table talking to someone and when a bell rings you move on to the <br/>
next person until you have met about 6 people, then you can choose <br/>
to actually date someone if that intial impression is good. <br/>
<br/>
anyway , it got me thinking about speed boxing. YOu have a big room <br/>
with tables arranged in a circle  and have two groups of people each <br/>
group on opposite sides of the table and everyone has a letterbox.  <br/>
basically the groups would rotate... one clockwise, one counter <br/>
clockwise...or actually one group could stay still and the other <br/>
rotated and stamp each letterbox....the possibilites are endless.<br/>
<br/>
You see, I am still jonesin for the Boch Family circus to come <br/>
visiting and I thought it might be fun to have a winter gathering, <br/>
say late Jan or Feb when the holidays have slowed down.  It could be <br/>
indoors,  at a mall food court or somthing like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe in Vallejo or the south bay.  What do you guys think?<br/>
<br/>
I also posted clues for the Markleeville Boxes.<br/>

Happy that school has started!  <br/>
Sad that the hurricane season is just reaching its peak, <br/>

Sounds SO fun!!<br/>

I had the chance to look at some of the journal books of some East Coast boxers during my <br/>
visit (notably the Boch Circus stamps - some of them are mind boggling) and was simply <br/>
amazed by some of the carvings I saw.  I decided that the reason my own carvings don't look <br/>
like that is that I have never learned drawing techniques such as shading and texture, and so <br/>
I cannot translate that into my carvings.  So, I am wondering if our artists artTrekker and <br/>
Lisascenic would be interested in teaching us some tricks of the trade to improve our <br/>
stamps?  I think I am technicially proficient enough to do the physical carving, but lack the <br/>
design skills.  Sound like a good indoor activity for the winter?  <br/>
