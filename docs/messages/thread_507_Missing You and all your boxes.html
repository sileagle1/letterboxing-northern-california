We are starting our 6th week of our 9 week trip away from California <br>
and we REALLY miss our fellow Northern Ca. boxers and all your <br>
wonderful boxes.  We are currently in New Hampshire for 4 weeks.  We <br>
are SO close to SO many boxes that are buried under more than a foot <br>
of snow and ice.  Landmarks are next to invisible and searching <br>
leaves tell-tale footprints.  On our cross-country sojourn, we added <br>
60 letterboxes to our find count.  In the past 10 days we have found <br>
two.(Finding them feltlike feeding an addiction - so satisfying.)  <br>
So when you all hear about the numerous boxes placed in New England, <br>
don't forget the challenges of the weather!<br>
<br>
On the other hand, we have been monitoring all the new letterbox <br>
placements in northern California.  You guys rock!  We can hardly <br>
wait to return and search for more of your creations, and add a few <br>
of our own.  The weather here does encourage one to carve stamps, <br>
make logbooks, and dream of long hikes in warmer environs.<br>
