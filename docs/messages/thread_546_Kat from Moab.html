I got a bunch of her boxes when I went to the Moab<br>
area in October. Very nice! Also, when I got home and<br>
went to the Lake Tahoe Mini Letterbox, I saw her stamp<br>
there! She was in CA when I was in UT & has<br>
connections to the North Shore. So she'll be back and<br>
looking for my boxes sometime. Fun stuff!<br>

Hey Arttrekker, thanks for your kind words. Annnnd, I see you've <br>
been VERY busy hiding around the lake. I'll definitely be by in the <br>
spring when I visit mom and dad near Truckee! I hope you come back <br>
and visit your friends in Castle Valley this year, because some <br>
great boxes have been finding their way to Moab by about five <br>
different placers.<br>
<br>
