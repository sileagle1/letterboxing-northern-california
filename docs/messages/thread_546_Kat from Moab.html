I got a bunch of her boxes when I went to the Moab<br/>
area in October. Very nice! Also, when I got home and<br/>
went to the Lake Tahoe Mini Letterbox, I saw her stamp<br/>
there! She was in CA when I was in UT &amp; has<br/>
connections to the North Shore. So she'll be back and<br/>
looking for my boxes sometime. Fun stuff!<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone! I'm Kat from Moab,Utah and decided to<br/>
&gt; check out the <br/>
&gt; N.Cal group and see what everyone is up to out in<br/>
&gt; California. I used <br/>
&gt; to live in Carmel until a couple of years ago when<br/>
&gt; we decided to <br/>
&gt; move to a different kind of paradise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Honour Bugz, do you live near the peninsula? I have<br/>
&gt; started leaving <br/>
&gt; boxes there when I come over every couple of months<br/>
&gt; and would love <br/>
&gt; it if there was someone close by to check on them.<br/>
&gt; My box, "A Good <br/>
&gt; Dog's Life" has been a pain lately, because the<br/>
&gt; State Beach rangers <br/>
&gt; have taken it and passed it around the district,<br/>
&gt; none of them <br/>
&gt; knowing what to do with a letterbox. I talked to her<br/>
&gt; on Friday, and <br/>
&gt; the boxes (I placed a first one, it disappeared, I<br/>
&gt; replaced it, it <br/>
&gt; disappeared) were in her office as of Friday. Did<br/>
&gt; you find it this <br/>
&gt; last weekend? She was saying she might put it back<br/>
&gt; where she found <br/>
&gt; it, but it would be better if I would come pick it<br/>
&gt; up from her. So <br/>
&gt; I'm confused about where they are!!!! (Gee, let me<br/>
&gt; just run by her <br/>
&gt; office from Utah real quick)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll be leaving another box out there in a couple of<br/>
&gt; weeks, but <br/>
&gt; definitely not near Asilomar State Beach!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I decided to say Hi and not just lurk in the<br/>
&gt; background! I <br/>
&gt; recognize lots of trail names here from some great<br/>
&gt; boxes I have <br/>
&gt; found on my drives to and from California. Thanks<br/>
&gt; everyone for <br/>
&gt; making a 15 hour drive even longer but much more<br/>
&gt; fun! LOL!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kat (Did you find the third box at Jack's Peak? We<br/>
&gt; looked everywhere <br/>
&gt; and couldn't find it)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Can't believe all the Monterey talk!  You all<br/>
&gt; should just get down <br/>
&gt; here and enjoy the beautiful boxes!  We snagged<br/>
&gt; Whales &amp; Sails, <br/>
&gt; Jack's Peak Trio, Free Falling, Point Pinos and A<br/>
&gt; Good Dog's Life <br/>
&gt; yesterday.  Today we journeyed down to the Big Sur<br/>
&gt; area and grabbed <br/>
&gt; the Lorax, Homestead and Oak Grove (eventful - saw a<br/>
&gt; Mountain Lion <br/>
&gt; and 4 deer on the trail!), then Way Cool, Saddle<br/>
&gt; Rock (a geo/lb <br/>
&gt; hybrid) and Canyon Owl (first finders!  Thanks<br/>
&gt; Don!).  Final one <br/>
&gt; tonight (felt like Carole out there in the dark) was<br/>
&gt; Big Sur <br/>
&gt; Marathon box!  These are all great!  Have 2 more<br/>
&gt; fun-filled days to <br/>
&gt; go!  Now that the golfers are out of town - we will<br/>
&gt; play in Carmel <br/>
&gt; tomorrow!  Let me know if you all have any questions<br/>
&gt; about boxes or <br/>
&gt; need us to check anything!<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Take care, Honour (BugZ) of the Boxalots<br/>

Hey Arttrekker, thanks for your kind words. Annnnd, I see you've <br/>
been VERY busy hiding around the lake. I'll definitely be by in the <br/>
spring when I visit mom and dad near Truckee! I hope you come back <br/>
and visit your friends in Castle Valley this year, because some <br/>
great boxes have been finding their way to Moab by about five <br/>
different placers.<br/>
<br/>
