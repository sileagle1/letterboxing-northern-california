Unless you get close enough to really see size, it is hard to tell<br/>
them apart.  Ravens have more massive beaks, and have a sort of<br/>
"shaggy" ruff around the neck.<br/>
<br/>
But both species are very clever, and curious, and get into all sorts<br/>
of trouble.  (Oh, and they often nest on cliffs.)<br/>

Here's a link from my home state:<br/>

<br/>
I don't know off-hand where Poe was living when he wrote The Raven,<br/>
but he was unlikely to have seen any in Baltimore!<br/>
<br/>
And here's a little tidbit about Poe's birthday:<br/>
http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/19/poe.mystery.ap/index.html?section=cnn_latest<br/>
<br/>
I have all sorts of peculiar Poe stories, having lived in Baltimore<br/>
for ages.  And if I *did* know anything about the person who leaves<br/>
cognac and roses on Poe's grave each year on his birthday, I certain<br/>
wouldn't go blabbling, no would I????<br/>
