[A different query than the geocacher literacy issue]<br/>
<br/>
Just the other day, I was thinking about my letterboxes, and suddenly <br/>
remembered that I hadn't heard a thing from a hitchhiker <br/>
called "Leap!" that I planted months ago. It's my only hitchhiker, so <br/>
I'm very curious about its whereabouts.<br/>
<br/>
Within 10 minutes of that thought, e-mail magically appeared from a <br/>
fellow in Lake Placid, NY, who had just found "Leap!" <br/>
<br/>
Strange, but true...<br/>
<br/>
Coincidence? Leap of faith? (pun - sorry)... Definitely synchronicity.<br/>
<br/>
SO, do letterboxers read minds? I think they do.<br/>
