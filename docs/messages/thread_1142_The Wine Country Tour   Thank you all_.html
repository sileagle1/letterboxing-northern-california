Just wanted to thank everybody who planted boxes in the Sonoma/Napa <br/>
counties wine country. Mutau Paul and I did our best to find as many <br/>

we didn't even get a sip of wine!<br/>

completely failed to find the letterbox.  On the other hand, we did<br/>
find Brine Country, which is a very cool stamp.<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to return, to pick up some of the beautiful mystery stamps!<br/>
