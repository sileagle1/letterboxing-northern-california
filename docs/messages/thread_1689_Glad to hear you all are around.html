Glad to hear everybody is still there, just quiet. I've been <br/>
letterboxing on the central coast this week between meetings. Won't be <br/>
able to go to the Monterey event unfortunately, I've got to go to <br/>
Lincoln, Nebraska and Kansas City. So will miss seeing everybody. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun in Monterey and <br/>
Keep Boxin<br/>
