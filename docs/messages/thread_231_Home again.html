happy to report that I was able to F60 and P6 while there.  If anyone <br>
EVER gets the chance to get to Connecticut, bring your letterboxing <br>
gear because they are EVERYWHERE.  I only spent about 36 hours there <br>
and got 37 boxes (hey, almost one for every hour), and many of those <br>
hours in was raining.  My favorite find of the overall trip was Prayer <br>
Rock in Bristol VT, which is considered to be the first letterbox <br>
planted in North America (in April 1998).<br>
<br>
But this is a Northern California list, so I shouldn't go on and on.  <br>
What I really wanted to say what how thrilled I was that there were 12 <br>
new boxes planted in the Bay Are while I was gone - way to go everyone! <br>
  I don't think this area has ever experienced that kind of growth <br>
spurt.<br>
<br>
I've also noticed that many of you have signed up on AtlasQuest and <br>
that's great!  Ryan is not paying me to say this, I promise:  this site <br>
is a lot of fun because it's like a virtual letterboxing journal - you <br>
get to record your finds and plants online.  But the catch is that in <br>
order to "find" someone's box, they have to list it on the site (it is <br>
not tied in automatically to the LbNA site).  Almost all of mine are on <br>
there, and I encourage everyone to list theirs too (so I can click on <br>
them as finds for myself!)   Seriously, it's a really cool site and <br>
Ryan worked hard on it.<br>
