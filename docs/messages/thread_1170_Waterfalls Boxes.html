Yes, we got the message from Team Safari about the missing box, but I<br>
 have a positive feeling that it is still safely tucked away but we<br>
cannot confirm at this time.  I would hate to think that someone had<br>
to climb down that rope for naught.<br>

Brandy is the one that reported that our Old Sac boxes were missing,<br>
but we found them all safe. <br>
