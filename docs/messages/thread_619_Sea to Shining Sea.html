Hi everyone, this post is a little different. It's for both <br>
Letterboxers and Postal Letterboxers.  About a week ago I was scrolling <br>
thru the LB -announce post when I stumbled on the Sea to Shining Sea <br>
Mystery box.  You need to go to LB.org to read the instructions.  To <br>
make a long story short.. The launcher was taking ( I am not sure if <br>
the quota is filled yet) a person from a list of States.  If you <br>
replied quick enough and were picked you get the box.  I did and was <br>
picked.  #1 on the list.  I just received it.  What a beautiful stamp. <br>
NOw the kicker is.. You take the stamp and of course do the normal PLB <br>
part at home but you also take the stamp and the log book that is <br>
provided with you and go letterboxing using their stamp also along with <br>
yours and do the normal letterboxing part.  This way not only do the <br>
Launchers have your stamp but others from our states.  I am going to <br>
try and do a few tomorrow since we are kicking back here at home.  <br>
Sound like this is going to be really neat, and I just wanted to share <br>
with you.  Happy Easter..  Michelle  <br>
