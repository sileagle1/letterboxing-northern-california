I think her<br/>
stamps On the Gold Trail may be one of my favorite relief prints of<br/>
all time.  It makes me think of Japanese woodblock prints, with their<br/>
incredible compositions, and implied narratives.<br/>
If you liked these, you really must get up to south Tahoe and Markleville and <br/>
see ArtTrekker's artistry. Canyon Canoers and the Hope Valley fly, Trout and  <br/>
Fisherman in her Fishing the West Fork series are incredible. We were lucky <br/>
to find 13 of her stamps in one weekend up there and feel we have tiny, little <br/>
works of art in our log books.<br/>
