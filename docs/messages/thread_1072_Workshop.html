sharing your notes and ideas?  I would love to know what was discussed <br/>
and bounced around.<br/>
I would love to go to the next one!<br/>
It sounds like the workshop was incredible!  I'm so jealous!  I've only <br/>
placed three boxes, one of which went missing before he Gold Rush Romp, <br/>
and the second missing the next weekend!  Pulled the last.  "my <br/>
precious" is now safe with me!! LOL<br/>
And I have to admit, "prank" boxes have me worried!<br/>
