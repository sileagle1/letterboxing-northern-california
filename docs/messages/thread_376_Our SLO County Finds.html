The Mntn Bike Mann's collected all of the Pleasanton Ridge series, by<br>
CoyoteClan last week-end and wants me to let everyone know that it is<br>
a great series with great stamps.  He's already told me that it is<br>
definitely not something for the Kool Kats to attempt.  Quite a hike!!<br>
<br>
We were on the Monterey Peninsula for Thanksgiving and stayed until<br>
Sunday.  Early Saturday morning my husband and I, Da Kool Kats and our<br>
son and daughter-in-law, the Mountain Bike Manns, headed down to SLO<br>
way to "fetch" a few boxes. We left at 6:30 a.m. Saturday and returned<br>
home at 1:00 a.m. Sunday.  Long trip and a full day with 1 good hike<br>
and 1 doozy of a climb.<br>
<br>
The first 2 boxes were done in a drizzling rain, the next two were<br>
done in the pouring rain.  By the time we got to the Mission (box #6)<br>
there was no rain, but a freezing wind was blowing!  Boxes 9 through<br>
14 were done in the dark.<br>
<br>
We were right "behind" Doublesaj and Old Blue on several of them.<br>
<br>
We managed to get:<br>
<br>
 1.  Fore in Atascadero, by Bobcat (more of a hike than we anticipated<br>
it would be).<br>
 2.  Royal Cup in Atascadero, by Bobcat<br>
 3.  Night Train Letterbox in SLO by Amanda<br>
 4.  Night and Day Mouse in SLO by JugglerMouse<br>
 5.  SLO Haloween Box by Buzzard<br>
 6.  Mission SLO de Tolosa by Sierra Sally<br>
 7.  The Other Building by JugglerMouse<br>
 8.  The Siberian Dwarf Hamsters on Stone Mountain by Emily Rose (Boy,<br>
what a climb!!)<br>
 9.  The Fellowship of the Ring in Arroyo Grande by Sir B<br>
10.  Ocean "O" in Oceano by Judy, Sleepy Cat & Princess Lea<br>
11.  Flutter in Pismo Beach  by Jam n Jelly<br>
12.  Fluttering Kings in Pismo Beach by jennby ( watch out for the<br>
black widow if you attempt this one in  the dark)<br>
13.  St. Patricks Flier #1 in Pismo Beach by Pandora<br>
14.  Hand of Sauronam in Pismo Beach by Sir B.<br>
<br>
Attempted, but not found:<br>
<br>
The Mill St. Box<br>
Smaug's Mountain<br>
Eye of Sauron<br>
Mr. Chong's Box<br>
St. Patrick's Flier #2<br>
<br>
Plus after solving Chaos Reigns, by Pandora, we drove all the way out<br>
to Lopez Lake in Arroyo Grande to collect the images.  <br>
The first 3 were missing, so my son did not want to waste any more<br>
time on the rest of them.  Someday, I want to go back to see if any of<br>
them are there.  Only because it was a lot of work to solve it and a<br>
long drive out there.<br>
<br>
Well, that's all for us<br>

Gwen & I found  #5, #6, #7, and #8 at Lopez Lake, and were sure #1 thru #4 were missing as of 3/7/2004. I think these were early Pandora carvings and we really loved #5. We rehid the one at Squirrel as it was in pieces,and some unemployeds had hidden a stash of stuff very close to the letterbox site. It seemed as though the stamps had been moved. The one we thought would be at #3 was actually at #6, but chaos happens when you open Pandora's letterbox? <br>
