We had a great time on Saturday, we did the Westwood Hills Regional <br>
Park Boxes in Napa. We found them both fairly easily and enjoyed the <br>
location immensely. Fabulous! Both were well hidden when we found <br>
them and we made sure we left them like that.<br>
<br>
We were laughing at the log book in which someone mentions there was <br>
a snake living in the hole! Great, tell us after we get the box out <br>
of the hole! Actually there were no problems and there was very <br>
little poison oak to worry about as well.<br>
<br>
We went with my sister and brother-in-law and kids. They are geo-<br>
cachers just starting with letterboxing. We are (new-ish) boxers and <br>
recent cache-converts too.<br>
<br>
So for those of you who like to do both boxing and cacheing (I call <br>
it geo-boxing), this is a fantastic location. We did two of each.<br>
<br>
Sunday, I spent the day carving stamps. So it was a great-all-around <br>
boxing weekend.<br>
