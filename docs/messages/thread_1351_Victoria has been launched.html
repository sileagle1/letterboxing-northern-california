say). I launched her today with Father Serra and the California <br>
Golden Poppy as passenger and cargo. So she's waiting for the next <br>
captain to take her to her next port. <br>
<br>
Please carve a stamp of a famous/significant Californian and/or an <br>
item of cargo that is significant to California and add to the ship <br>
(letterbox). Please see Message 3072 for full details. <br>
<br>
Please notify both the N. Calif and S. Calif lists when you pick it <br>
up and when you drop it off.<br>
<br>
Clues:<br>
<br>
Since Cabrillo was sent to California by the Vicroy of New Spain in <br>
1542, I thought it would be appropriate to launch her on a royal <br>
river just south of a royal city on one of the two major North/South <br>
highways. <br>
<br>
The exit has a rest stop on the East side of the highway. Go North <br>
along the frontage road on the West side of the highway toward the <br>
RV park. On the East side of the frontage road between the End of <br>
County road sign and the river rock gate post is the Victoria <br>
against the fence. (closest I could get it to the river without <br>
running the risk of some non letterboxer finding her)<br>
<br>
Happy Sailing<br>
