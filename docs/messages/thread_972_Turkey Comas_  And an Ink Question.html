We *saw* turkey this past week.  We were in a plane on Thanksgiving,<br/>
and they served everyone turkey sandwiches (as well as freshly baked<br/>
cookies and milk). <br/>
<br/>
And we saw letterboxing activity this weekend.  Saturday was Planet<br/>
Walk, which we got about halfway through before the sun ran out.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday was a lovely day with visiting letterboxers Rustypuff and CSCM<br/>
from Rhode Island, as well as local heroes Princess Lea and Sleepy<br/>
Cat.  It turns out that Robb and Sleepy Cat have known each other for<br/>
a while, as he was one of her after school acting coaches.  We<br/>
explored one of Livermore's parks, and in addition to finding all out<br/>
letterboxes, we saw a variety of bird life.  It was a lovely weekend.<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
<br/>
Now as far as ink goes.  One of the logbooks of Planet Walk was<br/>
soaking wet, some of the pages had been totally effaced, and some were<br/>
fine.  This made us wonder what types of inks everyone is using.  So,<br/>
here are the images that remained perfect:<br/>
<br/>
Anna and the Kids<br/>
Musicman of Burlingame<br/>
Adri<br/>
*the image of the bird-guy*<br/>
ArtTrekker (was a little faded, but didn't bleed)<br/>
Princess Lea<br/>
Just John<br/>
SFMOMO (slightly faded)<br/>
Red SF<br/>

I'll be mailing this logbook to Mimulus, who is is New Zealand at the<br/>
moment.<br/>

SF Scott and I did one box on Friday. We went to get<br/>
Vined Venue, out near Ripon, by Grumpy Ginch. We got<br/>
the first box, but then we got side-tracked<br/>
somehow...and we didn't get any of the other boxes.<br/>
This has been happening to us more and more. hehe.<br/>
(case in point - those boxes out near Land's End in<br/>
SF).  I think we enter time vortexes.<br/>
<br/>
As for the type of ink I used back then... Hmn! I'm<br/>
pretty sure it was from a mini collection of generic<br/>
inks I got from Papyrus. I've used many different<br/>
inks, but I know that I was using those small one inch<br/>
square spongey inks at that time. Nice to hear that it<br/>
held up  =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

We also "saw" Turkey out in Livermore - on the hoof!  Or should I say <br/>
on the claw (what are turkey's feet called??)  There was a small band <br/>
of wild turkeys out at Sycamore Grove who had managed to survive <br/>
Thanksgiving - they've probably been in hiding for months and only now <br/>
felt it was safe to come out!<br/>
<br/>
It was grand to see Lisa, Kim and Christopher again and to finally meet <br/>
Robb.  It was a very funny moment when we all realized that Robb and <br/>
Sleepy Cat were previously acquainted!  We were 4 for 4 out in <br/>
Livermore and they were all hand carved - hurray!<br/>
<br/>
So, what are the plans for a winter get together?  I think we may have <br/>
picked January 14th as a potential date?  This works for me!<br/>

<br/>
Livermore boxing sounds lovely-- we'll need to try<br/>
those next time we're out there--<br/>
<br/>
If the ink was black on those first four stampers, the<br/>
ink was "Memories" brand dye ink pad, by Stewart<br/>
Superior Corporation ("not to be taken internally")--<br/>
got the inkpads at Michaels and they come in a variety<br/>
of colors.  Nice to know it's waterproof like it says<br/>
it is!<br/>
