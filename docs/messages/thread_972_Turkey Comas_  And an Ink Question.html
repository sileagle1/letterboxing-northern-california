We *saw* turkey this past week.  We were in a plane on Thanksgiving,<br>
and they served everyone turkey sandwiches (as well as freshly baked<br>
cookies and milk). <br>
<br>
And we saw letterboxing activity this weekend.  Saturday was Planet<br>
Walk, which we got about halfway through before the sun ran out.<br>
<br>
Sunday was a lovely day with visiting letterboxers Rustypuff and CSCM<br>
from Rhode Island, as well as local heroes Princess Lea and Sleepy<br>
Cat.  It turns out that Robb and Sleepy Cat have known each other for<br>
a while, as he was one of her after school acting coaches.  We<br>
explored one of Livermore's parks, and in addition to finding all out<br>
letterboxes, we saw a variety of bird life.  It was a lovely weekend.<br>
<br>
*************<br>
<br>
Now as far as ink goes.  One of the logbooks of Planet Walk was<br>
soaking wet, some of the pages had been totally effaced, and some were<br>
fine.  This made us wonder what types of inks everyone is using.  So,<br>
here are the images that remained perfect:<br>
<br>
Anna and the Kids<br>
Musicman of Burlingame<br>
Adri<br>
*the image of the bird-guy*<br>
ArtTrekker (was a little faded, but didn't bleed)<br>
Princess Lea<br>
Just John<br>
SFMOMO (slightly faded)<br>

I'll be mailing this logbook to Mimulus, who is is New Zealand at the<br>
moment.<br>

SF Scott and I did one box on Friday. We went to get<br>
Vined Venue, out near Ripon, by Grumpy Ginch. We got<br>
the first box, but then we got side-tracked<br>
somehow...and we didn't get any of the other boxes.<br>
This has been happening to us more and more. hehe.<br>
(case in point - those boxes out near Land's End in<br>
SF).  I think we enter time vortexes.<br>
<br>
As for the type of ink I used back then... Hmn! I'm<br>
pretty sure it was from a mini collection of generic<br>
inks I got from Papyrus. I've used many different<br>
inks, but I know that I was using those small one inch<br>
square spongey inks at that time. Nice to hear that it<br>
held up  =)<br>

We also "saw" Turkey out in Livermore - on the hoof!  Or should I say <br>
on the claw (what are turkey's feet called??)  There was a small band <br>
of wild turkeys out at Sycamore Grove who had managed to survive <br>
Thanksgiving - they've probably been in hiding for months and only now <br>
felt it was safe to come out!<br>
<br>
It was grand to see Lisa, Kim and Christopher again and to finally meet <br>
Robb.  It was a very funny moment when we all realized that Robb and <br>
Sleepy Cat were previously acquainted!  We were 4 for 4 out in <br>
Livermore and they were all hand carved - hurray!<br>
<br>
So, what are the plans for a winter get together?  I think we may have <br>
picked January 14th as a potential date?  This works for me!<br>

<br>
Livermore boxing sounds lovely-- we'll need to try<br>
those next time we're out there--<br>
<br>
If the ink was black on those first four stampers, the<br>
ink was "Memories" brand dye ink pad, by Stewart<br>
Superior Corporation ("not to be taken internally")--<br>
got the inkpads at Michaels and they come in a variety<br>
of colors.  Nice to know it's waterproof like it says<br>
it is!<br>
