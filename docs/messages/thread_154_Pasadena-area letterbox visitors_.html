evening, I discovered that a certain Nancy Drew-ish letterboxer (not <br/>
Lea, the other one) has apparently grown fond of the Pasadena area <br/>
and recently dropped by my Leap Year letterbox.  Probably about the <br/>
time she stamped-in, I was recovering in my living room (not 100 <br/>
yards away) from my Saturday hike up into the Santa Monica Mountains <br/>
in search of funhog's Phoebe's Cabin LB.  Also recently stamped into <br/>
my Leap Year LB was my "Kernville Gathering" partner-in-crime Sierra <br/>
Sally.<br/>

Guilty as charged! And I was chatting with a certain Time Magazine <br/>
reporter while I was hunting the box! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also hunted up Leslie's South Pasadena series and nabbed a healthy <br/>
5 out of 7 of the boxes. <br/>
