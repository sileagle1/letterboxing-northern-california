thanks to da kool kats AND to Mimulus, Red, Scott and SFmomo had a<br/>
great day at Sugarloaf Ridge state park. We hit all 6 Sideways boxes,<br/>
all of the Planet Walk Boxes, Abamit and Her Shadow and Pomo<br/>
Hummingbird - for a grand total of 20 boxes. (20!! Our best to date<br/>
has been 7...but really, we have da kool kats to thanks for their<br/>
excellent help). We also picked up 3 HHs (TGIF HH #1, Ant M, and The<br/>
African Traveler). We dropped someone off too.<br/>
<br/>
About Pomo Hummingbird...we found the box open and the journal<br/>
completely soaked (it was sitting in water in the box). It looked like<br/>
the work of an animal. We spent some time squeezing all of the water<br/>
we could out of the journal (the stamp was okay). The journal is<br/>
salvageable and it looked like most stamp images were still intact. We<br/>
put everything back as dry as we could get it.<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
