<br/>
I was able to play hooky from work yesterday afternoon and went out <br/>
boxing.  Found in good condition the following:<br/>
<br/>
Vertigo #1:  This was a real toughie:  There were several busloads of <br/>
school kids on a field trip running amuck in the area.  Every time I <br/>
thought the coast was clear, another teacher would come back <br/>
hollering for one or another child, and sure enough, they would pop <br/>
out of the woodwork, while yet another previously-rounded up child or <br/>
two wandered back over behind the teacher's back.  Like watching <br/>
professional cat-herders at work.<br/>
<br/>
Euras The East Wind:  Crystal-clear air with great views all around.<br/>
<br/>
Magritte the Therapeutist:   The logbook is now full.  I didn't have <br/>
a spare logbook with me, unfortunately, so I ripped out some pages <br/>
from my notebook and left them in the box as a temporary measure.  <br/>
Many, many are obviously in need of therapy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for a great afternoon!<br/>
