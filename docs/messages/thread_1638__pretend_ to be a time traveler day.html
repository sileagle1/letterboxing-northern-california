Was Saturday, December 8th.  <br/>
<br/>
But the REAL time travelers in our midst can go back again and again<br/>
and chuckle knowingly.<br/>

Where do you ever find these web pages!!<br/>
<br/>
Well, in fact, I am just now back to the present. I spent 10 days in <br/>
1864. I met up with a fascinating young man, William Brewer on May <br/>
30th ...or was it the 31st (I am so bad with dates) I found him near <br/>
Pacheco Pass at Rancho de San Luis Gonzaga. He had spent the 3 previous <br/>
years (1860 - 1863) employed by the great State of California <br/>
exploring, studying and documenting this wonderful state. He has so <br/>
many magnificent stories. However, these are stories for another day. <br/>
<br/>
What struck me most about this trip was the severity of the drought. I <br/>
had forgotten this.  It makes last year's event seem truly minor. <br/>
<br/>
California - too much rain, or not enough; very little has changed.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is silly to pretend to time travel. Either one can or one <br/>
can not.<br/>

The whole idea is to pretend for the day that you are a traveler from a <br/>
different time - except that, of course, you can't actually *tell* <br/>
people you're a time traveler, because they'll think you're crazy. <br/>
