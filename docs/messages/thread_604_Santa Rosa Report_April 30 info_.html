Hello!<br/>
 I wanted to thank everyone who gave me info abd such about the <br/>
area. Sadly, we did not get much time to letterbox, but we did <br/>
manage to get a couple of boxes. First we went to Pacific Ridge <br/>
Oaks. It's at a winery, but we didn't make it all the way up the <br/>
hill. The Sculpture Garden was really neat, and had many trees to <br/>
keep up cool (since it was pretty hot for us, not being used to the <br/>
heat). My 4 year old really enjoyed it too, but be careful for <br/>
poison oak off the path. This box only had 3 visitors (counting <br/>
us)!? We enjoyed it! Thanks!<br/>
 We also went to the Healdsburg Quartet. This is a 4 series box. We <br/>
drove around since we were pressed for time. We did stay at the <br/>
playground for awile; it was super cool! I really liked the stamps <br/>
too! However box #3 was MIA. We still have plenty of boxes to get <br/>
when we return to the area in May. Thank you!<br/>
 I was also wondering about the April 30 gathering in Sacramento? <br/>
What happens there? I just started letterboxing less than 1 month <br/>
ago, so I am really new. How big is the event in Sacramento usually? <br/>
Just curious!<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

  I think this is the 1st Sacramento gathering.  I've only been boxing<br/>
since Dec, so I'm not sure.  The plan is to have a meet &amp; greet in the<br/>
morning, doing exchanges<br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.info/glossary/term.php?term=exchange) &amp; passing<br/>
out clue sheets.  Then a free-for-all of boxing for most of the<br/>
afternoon.  Finally meet back for awards, ice cream &amp; goodbyes.  I don't<br/>
remember the exact schedule, but I'm pretty sure it runs from 10-6.<br/>
There was talk of having some sort of demos (like carving), but everyone<br/>
agreed we wanted the maximum time for boxing.  If you look on the events<br/>
page at www.atlasquest.com, there's 24 people signed up, &amp; I know some<br/>
there are others that have RSVPed that aren't on that list.  Do you live<br/>
around Sacramento?<br/>

Count on THAT!!  You can learn SOOOO much in one day that might take you months <br/>
to learn on your own. <br/>

Come to the Gold Rush Romp! We'll treat you well!!<br/>
