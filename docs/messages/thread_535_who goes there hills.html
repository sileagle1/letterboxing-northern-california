&gt; Who Goes There? series.  All I can say is ouch, my muscles are sore<br/>
&gt; today. <br/>
<br/>
Our family got there a couple of weeks ago. To our amazement, we were first<br/>
finders! We were under some delusion that we could do it in 2.5 hours, and<br/>
had a date with someone at our house whose cell phone we didn't have. At 1.5<br/>
hours we realized we were barely half way through, and we practically ran<br/>
through the rest of it, passing by but not taking the time to find and stamp<br/>
the fifth box, for which we returned the next day. Our little one made it!<br/>
More amazingly, I made it. Took us a little over 3 hours. 4 hours would have<br/>
been much more human.<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful trails, wonderful stamps! Thanks, Blackbird!<br/>
