"So what's your Trailname?"  She blushed and she was mostly a<br/>
Geocacher and hadn't officially started her letterboxing yet.  I<br/>
helped her find her geocache which was across the path from my<br/>
letterbox and we both oohed over each other's finds.  It was rather<br/>
pleasant and cute.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard since that many geocachers will find letterboxes and<br/>
throw them away for some odd reason.  I find that rather disappointing<br/>
since it's basically a different take on the same hobby.  :(<br/>
