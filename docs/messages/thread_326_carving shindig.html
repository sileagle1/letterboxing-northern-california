WONDERFUL!! And if we're in Oakland, we'll be able to see if the 'Art' series <br/>
by Princess Lea is really there!<br/>

OK, I'm happy to do it here at school.  Let's decide on a weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Nov 20<br/>
Dec 4<br/>
Dec 11 <br/>
Jan 8<br/>
Jan 15<br/>
or later...<br/>
<br/>
All of these are fine with me.  Let me know which ones work with <br/>
you all and I can tally and set a date.  (Don't worry about the heat, <br/>
I turn it on in my room!) <br/>
<br/>
I'll set the date by next Friday, the 12th so folks can plan, consult, <br/>
whatever they have to do...The  school  is easy to get to, just off <br/>
580.  Directions to follow...<br/>

Thank you again Blackbird for your gracious offer.  I second the idea <br/>
of trying to hold this btwn Xmas and New Years so Lea can attend but <br/>
it sounds like Blackbird may be traveling.  Unfortunately all my <br/>
Saturdays seem pretty full except for January 8th.  So that is my <br/>
choice but whatever works best for everyone is the obvious choice.<br/>

Of course....boxing is a good and fun thing, as well.  So good and so fun...that we would try to fit it in almost anytime!  And we really need some tips on carving.<br/>
