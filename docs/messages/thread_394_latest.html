&gt; Oh yeh, almost forgot, after four years of<br/>
letterboxing we finally have a Jay Drew stamp image.<br/>
Wharf Cat.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't Wharf Cat the greatest? I knew as soon as I saw<br/>
him that he was special. What is the significance of a<br/>
"Jay Drew stamp image"? Is he famous? I emailed him<br/>
after I found that box in Sept to compliment him, but,<br/>
as a newbie, I have no other info.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there plant Birthday Bear HH? I was the<br/>
initial finder at Alien's box on Friday, but there is<br/>
no email address to contact the planter.<br/>
<br/>
I got another wild hair on Thursday and headed down to<br/>
West Marin to cavort with pirates (that dastardly Capt<br/>
Drake eluded me), aliens, and wildlife. Thanks to<br/>
Princess Lea, Alien Explorers &amp; Blackbird for<br/>
wonderful series(es?) in the area. I left a turkey on<br/>
a spaceship &amp; found the aforementioned Birthday Bear,<br/>
who is now keeping some creepy company and hoping for<br/>
rescue to rejoin the land of the living. Foundered in<br/>
fog and darkness, saw bunnies and mushrooms and banana<br/>
slugs, and many antlered ungulates. (Mule deer, fallow<br/>
deer, Tule elk!) Oh--when you check in at Bear Valley<br/>
Visitor Center for a map, be sure to take your log<br/>
book. They have three fun park stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think I will be able to make it to the stamp<br/>
carving party (blasted bad timing), but just in case a<br/>
miracle happens (or, as I told Blackbird, I blow off<br/>
all responsibility!) what time does the thing start? I<br/>
remember Lea saying something about 1 to 5, but don't<br/>
remember ever getting clear info about the actual<br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you're all enjoying your winter--remember, only<br/>
19 more days left to collect the temporary Happy<br/>
Holidays box before it disappears for ten months!<br/>

  Jay was the California Web Master when we joined letterboxing(he lives on the east coast). At that time you (as Planter) could not post / edit your clues the way you do now. The Web Master for your area took them off the chat list and they had control over them. Obviously it was a lot of work for those web masters. Now Jay being a transplanted Californian always entered the California clues very quickly, in fact supprisingly fast. If you peruse the Interview series that Mark Pepe has, then you can find Jay's interview. If you go to The Drew Clan's web site you can see an example of his carvings, and the transition he has made in his carving abilities, which are now pretty incredible. In all of my emails to him and his back to me, I can say it is a pleasure to know a good guy. Once in awhile when the topics on the main chat list get heated, he always comes in with some words of wisdom, or some soothing comments. He is definately a "Silver Back" in this game.<br/>
