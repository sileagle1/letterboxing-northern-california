Markleville and  see ArtTrekker's artistry. Canyon Canoers and the<br>
Hope Valley fly, Trout and   Fisherman in her Fishing the West Fork<br>
series are incredible. We were lucky  to find 13 of her stamps in one<br>
weekend up there and feel we have tiny, little  works of art in our<br>
log books.<br>

Oh I want to!!!!  This isn't a long weekend for me.  In fact, I'll be<br>
carving all day Monday.  Not erasers, but rather, huge mounds of<br>
styrofoam for an upcoming production at Berkeley Repertory Theatre. <br>
Not to name names, but there has been a lot of stress associated with<br>
this production.  Hire very talented, but no longer so young and spry<br>
actors, and then expect them to run around like a bunch of mountain<br>
goats on a huge carved "ash pile."  And who gets yelled at?  The<br>
director?  noooooo.....  the set designer?   oh noooooo......  how<br>
about the people who did none of the design, but had the carving tools<br>
in their hands?  Hey, that sounds right!<br>
<br>
Sorry, I needed to vent.  But to amuse y'all, I'll post pix of<br>
alternative forms of carving.  Sawz-Awl, anyone?<br>
