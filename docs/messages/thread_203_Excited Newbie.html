Just keep in mind--it is illegal to hide boxes in national parks.  <br>
If you DO hide a box in the park, you probably shouldn't publicize <br>
the clues too much or else the park personnel will pull it.<br>
<br>
Generally, it's best to hide it outside of the park where your box <br>
can live a long and happy life without fear of getting pulled in the <br>
immediate future.  =)<br>

Illegal? Or they don't like it?<br>
<br>
We have a series of three boxes (two left apparently) in a national park -<br>
only heard they don't like them after we planted them. But don't really want<br>
to break the law.....<br>

So, if any of you want to visit the Alien boxes while they're still there,<br>
go for it! They're an easy little hike, family friendly, and can be used as<br>
an excuse to visit one of the most beautiful areas on our beautiful planet<br>
(imho).<br>
<br>
The second box had been destroyed, but its contents found by a letterboxer<br>
and placed in the third box. However, the first box clues only direct the<br>
seeker to the second box! Don't despair - the third box is only a little<br>
further than the second. Follow the clues to the second box, and then keep<br>
walking until you get to the next likely place a box might be hidden under.<br>
