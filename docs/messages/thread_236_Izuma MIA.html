SLeepy Cat at the site to see the two great sleuths in actio.,  True <br/>
to form they zeroed in on the location quickly, but searched to no <br/>
avail!  Alas!  I checked on it two weeks ago and no one had visited it <br/>
yet, its first visitor prize still intact. I am thinking an animal was <br/>
involved and will recarve a new stamp and find a more secure location. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note I had a marvelous time seeing Princess LEa nd <br/>
Sleepy CAt, admiring their stamps from New England, and learning about <br/>
Dauber Duos.  Unfortunatley they had to scoot too soon to make it to <br/>
another place before it closed.  I hope they made it and averaged a <br/>
box an  hour on their trip up to Sonoma County.  <br/>
