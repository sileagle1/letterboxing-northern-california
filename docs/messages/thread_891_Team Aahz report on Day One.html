                    <div class="plaintext-content">My daughter, Zairabear, and I headed out to find our very first<br>
traditional letterboxes.  We had both done a couple of virtual<br>
letterboxes (both together and alone) before making this leap into<br>
"real" letterboxing.  As we were preparing our "hunting gear" it<br>
suddenly dawned on us that we should exchange stamps with each other. <br>
So when we hit the trail on our first official day of letterboxing we<br>
each already a single X count :-)<br>
<br>
Our first target was Saxon's Nemesis Mini Letterbox placed by Padfoot<br>
Stamper.  The trail was beautiful and the box was right where the<br>
clues said it would be.  The only problem we had finding this box was<br>
that I thought I knew where the starting point was, but ended up<br>
driving back and forth for about 30 minutes before finding the correct<br>
intersection.  It was a huge rush finding our first box!  Both Zaira<br>
and I were elated as we read through Saxon's Tale, examined every<br>
aspect of the box, pored over the logsheet, and failed miserably at<br>
being inconcspicuous.  We were just too excited!<br>
<br>
The second hunt of the day wasn't quite as rewarding.  We headed after<br>
Walk Like A Duck by workerofwood.  These clues were very intriguing<br>
(park on the river? ON the river?!?) but we managed to find the right<br>
starting point.  We then followed along the clues, calibrating our<br>
paces, etc and came to the mid-point where we were supposed to find<br>
further instructions.  The clue stated there would be a "little green<br>
box".  Well, we searched and searched around the area, but could find<br>
no hint of a "little green box".  The clues did go on to give<br>
suggested activities once the finish point was discovered, so we were<br>
able to eventually puzzle out where we needed to be.  However, once we<br>
found the (presumed) hiding spot we discovered that there was a hive<br>
of bees (or wasps, or other flying/stinging bugs) in the hole with<br>
dozens of them flying in and out in a pretty constant stream.  Neither<br>
of us were brave enough to search for the box, so this one gets<br>
chalked up as an attempt.<br>
<br>
We still had one more box to go.  Zairabear was really excited about<br>
doing Princess Lea's Nancy Drew Notebooks series for two reasons: 1)<br>
she's enamored of PrincessLea (first for her trailname and then<br>
because of her personal stamp (seen at Saxon's)), and 2) she read all<br>
of the Nancy Drew Notebooks.  Besides, this one was on the way home<br>
and right across the street from an ice cream parlor :-)  Once again<br>
we found the spot fairly easily, but this time we had a very tough<br>
time locating the box itself.  We spent maybe half an hour digging and<br>
poking before I gave up.  We even explored a nearby similar location<br>
that we (correctly) thought was the wrong space.  About fifteen<br>
minutes after I gave up, Zaira gave up as well, but asked that I take<br>
one more look.  I finally found the cement "marker" buried under about<br>
8 inches of dirt and leaves.  The box was under the marker as<br>
promised.  It turns out that the last person to find the box (I forgot<br>
to note their trailname) had found it one year to the day before! <br>
They had noted that it was an "easy" find.  Guess that shows what a<br>
year in even urban wilderness can do to a hiding spot.  When I<br>
replaced the box it was still well hidden, but should be a much easier<br>
find for anyone actually looking for it.<br>
<br>
We're both definetly hooked.  While this coming weekend is already<br>
booked solid with activities planned months ago, we're going to try to<br>
sneak in a couple of boxes as well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's the Team Aahz report for Day One.  We look forward to<br>
filing many, many more!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the intrepid new letterboxers, and thanks particularly for <br>
"rescuing" the Ice Cream Scoop box - for everyone's edification, I had <br>
not been able to make it down to Morgan Hill to check on the status of <br>
this box, and many people had reported it missing.  So glad it is still <br>
there - this box has had a strange life!  One time the stamp itself was <br>
missing so I recarved it, but then the original stamp was found nearby, <br>
so then there were 2 stamps in the box!<br>
<br>
So glad to have a new Nancy Drew fan in the midst!  For those of you <br>
with young readers, the Notebooks are a spin off of the Nancy Drew <br>
series and in them our favorite girl sleuth is 8 years old, and solves <br>
mysteries such as where someone lost their ring.  Very cute!  I highly <br>
recommend them.<br>
