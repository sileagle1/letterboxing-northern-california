I had similar thoughts about a recent hiking death near Grants Pass, <br>
OR (I apologize for the constant comments about Oregon but it's <br>
fairly close to where most of my Northern California letterboxes <br>
are, relatively speaking)--there was a recent report about a lady <br>
who fell and died along the trail to Rainie Falls in Hellgate Canyon <br>
last weekend).  There is a letterbox along the often quite steep <br>
trail and when I read it I instantly wondered if that group was out <br>
letterboxing there as that particular trail is in a fairly remote <br>
area.  Who knows?  Scary, nonetheless!<br>
<br>
**I also have a big request for any Northern, Northern California <br>
letterboxer.  I would like to permanently remove one of my <br>
letterboxes in the Whiskey Series up near Redding (thus making the <br>
series a single letterbox trek).  The clue is at:<br>
<br>
www.leecomputers.com/letterboxing/cgi-bin/boards/ikonboard.cgi?<br>
act=ST&f=7&t=3<br>
<br>
I've reconsidered the hiding spot as it may have similar <br>
consequences as the subject of this post.  The stamp really sucks, <br>
too--so it's no big loss to the letterboxing community.  So, if <br>
anybody happens to be headed up to this area anytime soon (the <br>
sooner the better), please let me know if you find this letterbox <br>
and whether you removed it.  Whoever removes it will have first dibs <br>
on a free cool letterboxing container for a future letterbox he/she <br>
might place.  I'd just 'kill' this box myself but I don't see <br>
anytime in the near future that I'm able to return to this spot (the <br>
hazards of long distance letterbox planting).  Thanks in advance,<br>
