Sorry we can't help you with clues, it's been too long since we've been down there but have a great time and let us know how many boxes you added to your F-count!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the help, folks!  We hit Big Sur yesterday and didn't get back until after 11:00 <br/>
PM.  We found 6, attempted 2 (it appears that Lisa's Sea Anemone is gone) and planted 1.  <br/>
We are taking it easier today and will just get boxes around town in SLO and maybe Avila <br/>
Beach.  Tomorrow it is back out to Cayucos/Cambria/San Simeon.  I have most of the clues <br/>
except Elephant Seals - does anyone have this info since LbNA is down until Sunday?  I <br/>
thought about just "geocaching" it out by the Elephant Seals lookout, but there are a <br/>
couple of spots for viewing so I thought it would be better to at least attempt to get the <br/>
clues.<br/>

Since I planted it let me see if I can remember the clues for Elephant  Seals <br/>
off the top of my head.. you're good you'll find it.<br/>

Go to the North end of the parking area look for the bench that is near the  <br/>
handicapped parking. It's between the parking area and the road<br/>
