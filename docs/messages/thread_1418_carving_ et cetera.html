bit trickier for me and Robb, because of the physical limitations he's<br/>
dealing with as a result of his spinal cord injury.  So, we're not<br/>
hunting as many boxes, or planting as much.  We probably could and<br/>
should pick up the pace on the planting.....but that means that I have<br/>
to be better organized!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, all this is a long way of asking:<br/>
<br/>
What are all you up to?  (And don't you want to plant some lovely<br/>
drive-by letterboxes in and around Alameda County?)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been doing some postal letter boxing lately... may plant a stamp or two<br/>
when they come back in.  I have a series of boxes I've been thinking of, and<br/>
they will be drive-bys, but haven't put the metal to the rubber just yet...<br/>
<br/>
I did a little letterboxing when we were in Southern CA (specifically<br/>
Pasadena) over the holidays - and picked up the Da Kook Kat's dinosaur<br/>
series in Santa Nella during our drive down.  These great boxes have<br/>
inspired me to get some carving done and do some more planting - and<br/>
finding!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing more of all of your boxes in 2007!<br/>
