                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's a summer series on NBC called Treasure Hunters.  It airs<br/>
Monday evenings at 9:00. <br/>
<br/>
It's very similar to the Amazing Race but the teams have to race to<br/>
solve clues to get to the next point. The maps and clues are much like<br/>
those in the movie National Treasure.  <br/>
<br/>
It started with 10 teams of 3 people. One team, the Young<br/>
Professionals, was eliminated this past Monday.<br/>
<br/>
The hype says the show will culinate with the winning team receiving<br/>
the richest prize in television history. <br/>
<br/>
If you were an Amazing Race fan or you like drama and adventure, you<br/>
may be interested in this.<br/>
<br/>
The teams are:<br/>
Ex-Cia (They met as CIA interns)<br/>
<br/>
Southie Boys  (3 men) Twins Matthew and Martin, both firefighters on<br/>
opposite sides of the country, grew up in South Boston with their pal<br/>
John.<br/>
<br/>
Genuises  (3 men)  College friends.  Their IQ ratings &amp; SAT scores <br/>
qualify them as genuises.<br/>
<br/>
Grad Students (3 women) Twins Jessica and Melissa are best friends<br/>
with Kat )<br/>
<br/>
Miss USA (3 women)  Beauty AND brains, that's what Miss USA touts.<br/>
<br/>
Air Force (husband, wife and male friend)  These Air Force officers<br/>
met their first year of basic training. <br/>
<br/>
Fogal Family (husband, wife and 20ish daughter)<br/>
<br/>
Brown Family (These three brothers used to play college football. <br/>
They plan to make up for their large size by relaying on their brains,<br/>
wit, humor and lifetime of playing competitive sports.<br/>
<br/>
Wild Hanlons (family that consists of a teenager and his dad and uncle).<br/>

Thanks for the heads up on this show KKs!  I TiVoed it and watched what I guess was the <br/>
2nd episode and it looks like a hoot!  However I did cringe when the one Team was up on <br/>
Mount Rushmore.  They don't really know what they are looking for, so they are looking at <br/>
anything that seems suspicious, including "unnatural" piles of sticks and rocks.  Eek!  I <br/>
kept thinking they were going to thrash some letterbox (or geocache's) hiding spot.  Will <br/>
have to follow this show closely to make sure they don't visit anywhere near any of my <br/>
boxes!<br/>
