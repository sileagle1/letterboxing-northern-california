                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's a summer series on NBC called Treasure Hunters.  It airs<br>
Monday evenings at 9:00. <br>
<br>
It's very similar to the Amazing Race but the teams have to race to<br>
solve clues to get to the next point. The maps and clues are much like<br>
those in the movie National Treasure.  <br>
<br>
It started with 10 teams of 3 people. One team, the Young<br>
Professionals, was eliminated this past Monday.<br>
<br>
The hype says the show will culinate with the winning team receiving<br>
the richest prize in television history. <br>
<br>
If you were an Amazing Race fan or you like drama and adventure, you<br>
may be interested in this.<br>
<br>
The teams are:<br>
Ex-Cia (They met as CIA interns)<br>
<br>
Southie Boys  (3 men) Twins Matthew and Martin, both firefighters on<br>
opposite sides of the country, grew up in South Boston with their pal<br>
John.<br>
<br>
Genuises  (3 men)  College friends.  Their IQ ratings & SAT scores <br>
qualify them as genuises.<br>
 <br>
Grad Students (3 women) Twins Jessica and Melissa are best friends<br>
with Kat )<br>
<br>
Miss USA (3 women)  Beauty AND brains, that's what Miss USA touts.<br>
<br>
Air Force (husband, wife and male friend)  These Air Force officers<br>
met their first year of basic training. <br>
<br>
Fogal Family (husband, wife and 20ish daughter)<br>
<br>
Brown Family (These three brothers used to play college football. <br>
They plan to make up for their large size by relaying on their brains,<br>
wit, humor and lifetime of playing competitive sports.<br>
<br>
Wild Hanlons (family that consists of a teenager and his dad and uncle).<br>

Thanks for the heads up on this show KKs!  I TiVoed it and watched what I guess was the <br>
2nd episode and it looks like a hoot!  However I did cringe when the one Team was up on <br>
Mount Rushmore.  They don't really know what they are looking for, so they are looking at <br>
anything that seems suspicious, including "unnatural" piles of sticks and rocks.  Eek!  I <br>
kept thinking they were going to thrash some letterbox (or geocache's) hiding spot.  Will <br>
have to follow this show closely to make sure they don't visit anywhere near any of my <br>
boxes!<br>
