It has a great walk, a lovely stamp, and hasn't been visited nearly as often as it deserves. In honor of da Kool Kats, I found it in the last vestiges of light on Friday, stamped in by headlamp, and hiked out with the beam of my headlamp reflecting off my dog's rear end to guide me out. Carole, it's about 2 miles round trip with a few little hills, but you can do it! You done much worse. The park gate does close at 7 pm, so you want to give yourself time to get out, but you could conceivably do it after work! (well, maybe not.) Rattlesnake Bar Road is also closer to Auburn than to Folsom--it wasn't on my Folsom map--so make sure you go far enough on the Auburn-Folsom Road.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone is having a great weekend,<br/>
