Please take a little extra care to help keep the insides of the box <br>
dry. Bring some paper towels with you. When you pull the box up out <br>
of the water, there's likely to be a small amout of dirt or algae on <br>
it, even though its not in stagnant water. Dry off the outsides <br>
before opening the box. When closing the box, check to see that <br>
there is no dirt, sand or grit in the watertight seal. Also make <br>
sure that the plastic bags for the journal and stamp don't get in <br>
the way of the seal as well.<br>
<br>
When I last checked, a bit of dirt broke the seal on the box, <br>
letting in a small amount of water -- enough to soak the journal, <br>
which was in a plastic ziploc that wasn't completely zipped. Until I <br>
replace the journal, please feel free to stamp your journal w/o <br>
stamping in the box's journal.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

<br>
I found this box tonight, and have some sad news.  Everything <br>
was missing from the box...there was water inside the box and <br>
some additional dirt in the seal. I cleaned everything to the best <br>
of my ability and looked everywhere for where the items may <br>
have been put...but I wasn't able to find anything.<br>
<br>
I am really sorry to report this....<br>
