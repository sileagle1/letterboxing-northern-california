As ye plant, so shall ye re-plant, I guess. I'm beginning to think that the less obvious a hiding place is & the more overlooked by any who might frequent an area, the more successful it will be for Lb. or not. I guess we're always taking a chance, and the wonderful thing is when they last at all. I finally just found Folsom Powerhouse yesterday, and that box was planted in 2001!<br>
