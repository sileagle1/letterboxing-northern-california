I LOVE this idea! Want to jet down to SF right now. I read a really<br>
cool novel called "A Case of Curiosities", that you might really like:<br>
http://www.amazon.com/Case-Curiosities-Allen-Kurzweil/dp/0156012898/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-6516450-3231343?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181947956&sr=1-1<br>
I have plenty of curiosities of my own, and some of my artwork falls<br>
into this realm, as well.<br>
<br>
Oooo, can't wait! aT<br>
