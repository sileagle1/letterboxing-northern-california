Hey, we're planning an 'off the beaten path' letterboxing trip from <br/>
Tacoma, WA to San Diego and back for a few weeks in February.  It's <br/>
been ages since we were last down that way and letterboxing has <br/>
certainly grown exponentially since we hid some boxes in the area a <br/>
couple of years ago (a handful in/around Redding and another in <br/>
Monterey)--any recommendations for scenic driving routes and <br/>
letterboxing ideas along the way--spanning from the Oregon border <br/>
all the way to San Diego? What are some of the 'do not miss' <br/>
letterboxes along the way?  We especially enjoy boxes with <br/>
historical or geological significance, incredible views and 'unique' <br/>
experiences and that sort of thing.  We also enjoy letterboxes based <br/>
on old fashioned 'kitsch'y tourist attractions, as well (teapot <br/>
buildings, giant cowboy hats, the world's largest frying pan, etc--<br/>
we've seen a lot of them as you can tell).  ;)<br/>
<br/>
We haven't decided which route we'll take yet--we're leaning on I-5 <br/>
South most of the way heading there and then 1/101/1 North on the <br/>
return trip--but we're up for anything.  We'll be 'roach moteling <br/>
it' and camping along the way with definite stops in Sacramento, San <br/>
Diego, Marin County (my old stomping ground from '77-'81--I guess <br/>
that ages me a bit?) &amp; a few In N Out Burgers along the way.  <br/>
Hmmm...camping in February...with 2 little kids...crazy??? <br/>
Definitely!  We'll appreciate any ideas/recommended routes you can <br/>
offer!!!  We'll also be up for meeting with folks who'd like to <br/>
exchange sig stamps, too, if anybody's interested.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

get a couple of new ones in Davis while you're at it?<br/>
<br/>
On your way back up Hwy 1, we recommend our St. Patrick Series in Mendocino <br/>
and Ft. Bragg. Have had many compliments on them and were informed all are <br/>
alive and well as of last week.<br/>
<br/>
There are many in Golden Gate Park now (Playland Lives, T it Up, the <br/>
Conservatory series, and others). If you haven't gotten Tip of Shasta, it's alive on <br/>
Hwy 5 north of Redding. If you swing over a little to Hwy 99, we just got 6 in <br/>
Lodi yesterday, all were by Grumpy Grinch.<br/>
<br/>
Hope we can connect while you're sailing through!<br/>
