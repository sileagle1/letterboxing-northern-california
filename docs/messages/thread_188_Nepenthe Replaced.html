I had to revise the clues a bit, based upon changes that occured in <br/>
the area. For those of you who have already found Nepenthe, you may <br/>
remember the lion (that almost perplexed a couple of you)... well, <br/>
the lion has vanished! I'm trying to picture it face down in a <br/>
dumpster, or sitting out by the curb, waiting for trash collection, <br/>
but I don't think that's its fate. Maybe it just walked away...<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how I found the time to recarve the stamp and replant <br/>
the box, but since its been a favorite, I'm more than happy to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I've been busy completing a box in time for this weekend's Golden <br/>
Gate Gathering. You know I couldn't let this opportunity pass <br/>
without a splash, so...<br/>
<br/>
in time for Saturday:<br/>
<br/>
The Hunt for the Temple of Neptune of the Lost City of Atlantis, <br/>
Tlamco  (2 "key" boxes leading to an underwater letterbox).<br/>
<br/>
Betcha didn't know that there's a legend that goes back to the 19th <br/>
century that says that San Francisco was once "Tlamco", a city of <br/>
Atlantis... (YES!)<br/>
