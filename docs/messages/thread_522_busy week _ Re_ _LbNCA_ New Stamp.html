                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all-- I started out the week at the SF Int'l Gift Fair, buying for our businesses, but I also found Boku books and ordered a bunch of very cool journals for us! I will be bringing them to the GRR. They make a tiny journal--about an inch &amp; a quarter by 2 inches or so--that is just right for HHs. Also other, more standard sizes.<br/>
<br/>
I finished early Monday afternoon and went to Baker Beach to get Tara's SF Landmarks. I love those little stamps! Tuesday looked again for Mystery in the Haunted Mansion #1 but still couldn't find it. Is this missing? or am I being clueless?<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday up to wine country, afternoon off &amp; wanted to warm up for Sugar Loaf, so went after The Four Seasons, Word to the Wise (found Ant M HH), Sleep Drunken Bacchus &amp; Persephone. Didn't have time to decode Demeter, but finally retrieved Brine Country. Duh. Must have looked right through it on the first two tries.<br/>

We really enjoyed your old stamp - just love those Kool Kats.<br/>
<br/>
Being suckers for torture (but only in the daylight hours!) we journeyed back to SLRSP and did the Sideways series.  What great boxes - but quite the hike!  We stamped in behind Kool Kats in each box (except #5 - we picked up the Black Bear Paw hitchhiker - thanks Mimulus!).  Box #6 is a beautiful stamp!  And we missed Pluto on this trip as well....because....well we aren't sure how we missed it!  Exhaustion maybe!?  Also enjoyed the lovely Pomo Hummingbird.  Mimulus is tireless!  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, Mimulus is AMAZING!!!!!! Big, beautiful stamps, great locations, clever containers &amp; hiding techniques. Mom and I did the Planet Walk, Abamit and Her Shadow and also Sideways. I knew it was going to be long, I knew there were some hills, but REALLY!!!!  ;x Have these trail builders never heard of SWITCHBACKS??!!?? Carole, I am SO impressed. I just kept thinking of you and Gary and arthritis and couldn't believe you really did it. And twice??? Did you do those hills twice? I made an extra impression of Sideways Box #5 for you--you can't really count it as an F, but I thought you deserved to have the stamp anyway. (Give me your address &amp; I will send it.) I also loved your Kool Kats stamp and look forward to seeing the new one.<br/>
<br/>
My mom lost her stamp at Smoking Loon, so if anyone finds it, please let me know. I carved it for her in a pinch and didn't really like it that much anyway, so now she'll have to carve herself a new one. :-) We also missed Pluto--we were so tired of going up and down that when we came to a fork in the path--taking us around the peak instead of up over it--we rejoiced in going around and only realized our mistake when we got to Neptune. I didn't have the time or the energy to go all the way back, and, frankly, I may never go back up those hills! but I was sorry to have missed the Mr. Mom stamp. We also didn't have time for Pomo hummingbird, so I will be going back to the park at some point. I DO think Tara's husband would find this hike right up his alley. He could jog the whole thing. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sonoma is a great place to up your F count--mine is at 133 now, and I have filled my first log book, so I get to start a new one! If anyone is inclined to plant in Sonoma County, I know Mimulus would be thrilled. She really has made a huge contribution to fun for the rest of us. I want to plant more boxes in the Healdsburg area, so will be making that a priority in the next few months, as well as getting boxes ready for the GRR. I already have three stamps carved &amp; more ideas on deck. It's going to be fun!!! (Also, more new boxes for Tahoe, but this is one of those winters that is keeping everything under snow for awhile, so still no access yet.)<br/>
<br/>
As Ryan would say, Happy Trails!!<br/>

Uh oh, hope it's not gone AGAIN.  I did revise the clues so the box <br/>
would be hidden in a more suitable place - do you have the newest <br/>
edition?<br/>
