                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
I am coming to San Francisco in May for just a few days from NJ.  I <br/>
was wondering if you could recommend a few quick boxes (I'll be with <br/>
my non-letterboxing son- we call them Noxers)that can be found using <br/>
public transportation only.  We won't have a car.  We'll be staying at <br/>
Fisherman's Wharf but of course we'll be touring around as much as <br/>
possible. I would feel just terrible if I couldn't pick up at least <br/>
one box as I have found a box in every state I've visited since I <br/>
began boxing in 2004.  I now have 14 states.  Thanks in advance for <br/>
your suggestions.<br/>

I'm sure that others closer to S.F. than us can let you know the best boxes  <br/>
but I wanted to suggest that you let the LbNCA 'boxers know exactly when <br/>
you'll  be in town so we can maybe get together for a little exchange. Who knows: <br/>
if  some of us are available, maybe we'll schlep you around in our cars and go  <br/>
'boxing with you so you don't have to bother with bus schedules!  <br/>
