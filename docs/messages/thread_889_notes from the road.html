                    <div class="plaintext-content">Robb and I had the pleasure of spending time with the Grumpy Grinches<br>
this Saturday.  Their son is one of the Berkeley fire fighters who<br>
organized a wonderful benefit bar-b-que for the Berkeley Repertory<br>
Theatre.  The Grinches are a wonderful duo who completely fail to live<br>
up to their grumpy reputation.  We're hoping to get down to Lodi to<br>
further explore their neck of the woods.  In addition to boxing and<br>
socializing, we want to have another look at the amazing sandhill<br>
cranes that overwinter in Lodi!<br>
<br>
In our ongoing effort to keep any other boxes from getting inferiority<br>
complexes, we wish to report that instead of finding nineteen boxes,<br>
we accomplished very little this weekend boxing-wise.  We headed out<br>
to find a few boxes that I had already found, and totally forgot to<br>
bring along the clues for the new box in that area.  <br>
<br>
Robb did find Chabot's Alien (which someone -- ME????? -- seemed to<br>
have hidden poorly this past spring) and Blackbird's Fairy Rings. <br>
Line Alien will have to wait for another visit.  <br>
<br>
I'm knitting a jacket for a friend's wedding, on teeny tiny needles. <br>
Until I get that finished, I doubt I'll be doing much hiking, or<br>
boxing.  The pattern is too tiny, and the fiber is too pristine to<br>
take on the trail.  It would be just my luck to be concentrating on my<br>
cable-knitting, and fall off of a cliff.<br>

whose works of art are inspiring. We thoroughly enjoyed the <br>
conversation, the good food and the hometown feeling in downtown <br>
Berkeley Saturday.<br>
<br>
After we left the fund-raiser, we found a couple of boxes in <br>
Emeryville.  We picked up another one on Sunday before going to SBC <br>
Park.  That put us at the magic FOUND 400 mark!!!  Yeah.  <br>
