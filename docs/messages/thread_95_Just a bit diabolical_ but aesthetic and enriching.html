                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's what I'm trying to incorporate in my 1st letterbox: aesthetic <br>
and enriching elements. I hope the aesthetic touches will be <br>
appreciated, and that there will be some new factoids/tidbits gained <br>
along the way that will make it worth the while to get to my <br>
letterbox(es).<br>
<br>
Working on my first right now, and I might as well let you all know <br>
that it's Box #1 of a 3 part series. I'm designing it so that you <br>
MUST do them in order, because each one will need something from the <br>
prior solution. (That circumvents some attempts at guessing w/o <br>
solving and skipping some of my work - heheheh!)<br>
<br>
Yes, time consuming, and the mess in my apt. shows it! I have vast <br>
supplies of art and craft items that are coming in very handy. I <br>
figure if I'm going to do these, they might as well be art in <br>
themselves. I also hope that by doing this, they'll have more <br>
appeal, and hopefully, more traffic.<br>
<br>
I also pulled out my collection of books about weird and strange <br>
places in San Francisco... a wealth of ideas in my hands and already <br>
working with my vivid imagination... and you thought you knew San <br>
Francisco! Ha ha ha ha ha! [EVIL GRIN]<br>
