Robb ended up with a flat tire from all the thistles at the Vacaville<br/>
event.  He spent a lot of time pulling the spines out of his inner tubes.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a toungue twister that a lot of actors say during vocal warm-ups:<br/>
<br/>
"Stanislavsky's little sister was a syphillitic thistle-sifter."<br/>
<br/>
Stanislavsky is the person whose "Method" method actors use.<br/>
<br/>
As far as fences goes....someone alluded to climbing over a fence this<br/>
weekend whilst letterboxing, and I wondered if that was the fence that<br/>
is now apparently enclosing the Art Deco Floral Depot letterbox in<br/>
Oakland.  Was another fence scaled, instead?<br/>

only now to discover that our lawbreaking episode was in vain. Once <br/>
we got inside we apparently just did not think outside the "box" or <br/>
fence as it were.... we are very happy to hear that the box was <br/>
rescued though!<br/>
