It's a GRAND idea to have letterboxes in the Pubs! It does help when <br/>
you know the owner or manager and can convince them that it is a good <br/>
idea. <br/>
<br/>
The letterbox that I have inside a store is a mystery box, the owner <br/>
of the store and I talked about it, and he preferred a mystery box, <br/>
so that it would cut down on the "traffic" coming in just to get the <br/>
box and not to buy anything! <br/>
<br/>
What do you think the etiquette is on retrieving a letterbox in a <br/>
store or business? Do you feel compelled to buy something? I always <br/>
do! I have gotten letterboxes at coffee shops and in pubs and <br/>
bookstores, rubberstamp stores etc and I always make a little <br/>
purchase.<br/>
