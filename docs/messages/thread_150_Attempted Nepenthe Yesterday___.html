I know exactly where the guys were sitting, and w/o giving anything away about this box to the rest of LbNCA, I think you could've pulled it off. All you needed to do was get to the other side of them by going on the rocks, then creep up from the other side to reach it. I know from experience, because I stopped by to monitor the box one day, and that's what I did while people were sitting right there.<br>
<br>
You could've also pretended to be looking for lost keys or something. They wouldn't have been at the right angle to see you pull out the box. Or you could have been pretending to find a good spot to listen to the "Oracle".<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's such a nice place to visit over and over. It was a Friday afternoon on a crystal clear day when I planted it. I had the place to myself, and ended up just enjoying it for a whole hour.<br>

Maybe we should post a sign that says, "Letterboxers Only!". <br>

Nepenthe, lol.  I dreamt that I went back, and there were a whole <br>
bunch of people still...so I thought of your advice...I decided <br>
I'd "drop" my watch into the area so that I have an excuse to poke <br>
around in there.  It took me forever to get the darn thing off and <br>
was very loud.  But I did it, and the stamp was really cool...all I <br>
remember was that there were clouds and I wanted to stamp it in a <br>
light blue color (who says we don't dream in color?!?).  <br>
Unfortunately tomorrow my husband and I are leaving town for a few <br>
days, and wont get to re-attempt Nepenthe until we get back...I hope <br>
it doesnt haunt me every night I'm gone!! LOL<br>
