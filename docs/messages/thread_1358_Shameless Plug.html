 I am planning to do some box maintenance up in The Oakland Hills some<br/>
time this week, and nab the boxes I am missing up there too.  I have<br/>
been in a carving funk too - I feel the need to out-do myself and this<br/>
leaves me frozen in terms of attempting anything.  But I do need to<br/>
replant Sushi House and Playland, and also do the next box for the<br/>
Lunar New Year series.  I am also going up to Tuolumne County with the<br/>
Girl Scouts next weekend and may or may not get a chance to do some<br/>
boxing then.  <br/>
<br/>
The good news is that I got to letterbox every single day from<br/>
Christmas through New Years Eve! My family was very patient (I guess<br/>
you could consider it a Christmas present that they tolerated all the<br/>
hunting).  We were on a road trip down to San Diego to watch the Cal<br/>
Bears play in the Holiday Bowl (Go Bears!  Missed you DoubleSaj&amp; Old<br/>
Blue!).  Went the I5 route on the way down, and Highway 99 back for<br/>
maximum box exposure.  While most of the finds were down in So. Cal.,<br/>
in N. Cal. I did manage to finally nab some of Sierra Sally's Fresno<br/>
Cultural Trail boxes and the new ones in Hilmar.  <br/>
<br/>
It looks like I am not going to start any new jobs until the end of<br/>
January, so I am hoping to get some boxing done this month, weather<br/>
permitting.  I need to hit Vacaville, Monterey, Marin, Petaluma....<br/>

If you are San Francisco Bay Area based, I just might take you up on<br/>
your offer to play hooky.  I'm a consultant, which means when my<br/>
clients go skiing for the month of January I spend lots of time in the<br/>
garden or hiking alone.  Email me directly offline if you are still<br/>
looking for someone to tag along for an afternoon.<br/>

&gt; &gt; How timely.  I woke up this morning thinking about the series i am<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to plant in Oakland next time i visit.  I am actually<br/>
&gt; carving,<br/>
&gt; &gt; planning, making journals and otherwise consumed with Lbing.  oh<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; am all over the boards too.   I promise to check this board out<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; often.  And i hope to be able to make the April 1st gathering in<br/>
&gt; San<br/>
&gt; Jose.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We've done no boxing for nearly 2 months.  After moving from Lodi<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; late November, we lived out of suitcases until last weekend.  We<br/>
&gt; spent <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this past week moving into our new home in San Jose.  All our <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing gear is now out of boxes, but temporarily stashed in<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back of a closet.  We look forward to hitting the trails again<br/>
&gt; soon.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, we read the groups regularly and rejoice in everyone<br/>
&gt; else's <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing adventures.<br/>

&gt; can't <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box, we like to hear the news about the ones that are boxing.<br/>

  No one seems to be doing much letterboxing lately or even looking for<br/>
  the clues on line, so I'm letting all of y'all, especially the ones in<br/>
  the Sacramento area, know that we have a new box. Check the mystery<br/>
  boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  Just because we can't get out to do any boxing doesn't mean that the<br/>
  rest of you have to wait until the end of tax season, as well. (smile)<br/>
<br/>
  And, why has this LbNCA group been so quite lately? Since we can't<br/>
  box, we like to hear the news about the ones that are boxing.<br/>
