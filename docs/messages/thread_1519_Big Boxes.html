HA!  3CatFam is in the Guiness Book for World's Largest Letterbox<br/>
Series: Monument Kitty.  It's a bit of a walk, but well worth it.  And<br/>
there is plenty of room for a HH. <br/>
<br/>
Or our (dem xx men) Trivial Pursuits would probably hold it.<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of right now...<br/>
