Today I thought I'd go plant a box a bit south of<br/>
home...  Reached into my bag of boxes waiting to be<br/>
planted and found... YIKES!!!  The box I thought I had<br/>
planted in San Francisco (north of home!) a month or<br/>
so ago!!!!  I was pretty horrified as the planted box<br/>
(which is the same shape and size) had NOTHING to do<br/>
with the site and was intended for somewhere entirely<br/>
different...  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I went to see if this was indeed the case and<br/>
yes, about 8 finders had graciously stamped in and<br/>
kindly expressed their surprise at what they found,<br/>
instead of saying, "What the heck is this???".  You<br/>
wonderful people know who you are!!!  Thank you for<br/>
preserving my dignity.  I have now planted the correct<br/>
box at the site- it will make much more sense now--<br/>
and the new plant is a bit less exposed so check the<br/>
newly edited directions if you find time to go.<br/>
<br/>
What a nice group of people you all are for<br/>
appreciating the effort put into a box even if it is a<br/>
bit out of context!<br/>
