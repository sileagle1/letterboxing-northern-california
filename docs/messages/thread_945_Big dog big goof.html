(particularly LbNCA ones) are the nicest people in the<br>
world.<br>
<br>
Today I thought I'd go plant a box a bit south of<br>
home...  Reached into my bag of boxes waiting to be<br>
planted and found... YIKES!!!  The box I thought I had<br>
planted in San Francisco (north of home!) a month or<br>
so ago!!!!  I was pretty horrified as the planted box<br>
(which is the same shape and size) had NOTHING to do<br>
with the site and was intended for somewhere entirely<br>
different...  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I went to see if this was indeed the case and<br>
yes, about 8 finders had graciously stamped in and<br>
kindly expressed their surprise at what they found,<br>
instead of saying, "What the heck is this???".  You<br>
wonderful people know who you are!!!  Thank you for<br>
preserving my dignity.  I have now planted the correct<br>
box at the site- it will make much more sense now--<br>
and the new plant is a bit less exposed so check the<br>
newly edited directions if you find time to go.<br>
<br>
What a nice group of people you all are for<br>
appreciating the effort put into a box even if it is a<br>
bit out of context!<br>
<br>
