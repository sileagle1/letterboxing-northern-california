Lea named him) who's having some medical problems. Old Blue is a sensitive guy  <br/>
and is simply dealing with aging parents. It's tough. . .but let me tell you <br/>
all  something. . .<br/>
<br/>
. . .in the midst of arranging for 24/7 home care, hospitals, with very  <br/>
little sleep and fairly stubborn individuals who want things to be as they've  <br/>
always been (don't we ALL) when he had 'help' for 3 hours this afternoon, did he  <br/>
want to take a  nap? No. Did he want to go out to lunch? No. He wanted to  <br/>
letterbox!! We went on a little hike, found a box and it really relaxed him.  <br/>
Hadn't seen him smile in several days.<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful outlet Letterboxing is for us!! I'm really so grateful we  <br/>
found it!! Thanks to you all!  <br/>
