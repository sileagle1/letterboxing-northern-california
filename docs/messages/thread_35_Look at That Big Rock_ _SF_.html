we decided to try and get this new letterbox in San Francisco.  The climb was a little <br/>
more than we bargained for!  Lots of stairs and then a challenging uphill climb at the <br/>
end.  I just did a search for Mt. Sutro and it says it is 834 feet high - I'm not sure how <br/>
high you are when you start, but it was fairly close to sea level, and you also don't <br/>
quite reach the summit for the box (unless you're like Ryan and you go to the top just <br/>
to say you've done it).  But there's definitely an elevation change to be expected!  <br/>
There were some great views of the city - just be prepared for a non-urban style <br/>
hike.  I even managed to stumble coming down the hill, but no lasting injury, so save <br/>
the Purple Heart for someone else.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed over to a letterbox-geocache hybrid that's also in the city.  I had <br/>
prepared a stamp to place inside since the geocacher planter had forgotten to include <br/>
one originally (I got the guy's permission).  I'll add the link to this "bonus box" on my <br/>
Message in the Haunted Mansion series since it's somewhat nearby - well at least <br/>
within a mile.  The clues to the box are wonderful (you can look up the general <br/>
location on the map and don't require a GPS thingie) - I suspect the guy is really a <br/>
letterboxer at heart but he just doesn't know it.<br/>
