You were talking about putting a face on a stamp.  If you'll notice my <br/>
personal stamp, its my profile.<br/>
<br/>
I took a digital photo of myself and printed on plain paper to a decent <br/>
size.  Then just trace the details and then rub them onto the stamp and <br/>
carve.  It was pretty simple and it looks just like me!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
