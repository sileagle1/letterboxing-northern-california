Ryan, I crossed posted  since there may be some LbNCA folks that <br/>
aren't receiving SoCal List.<br/>

With the help of Peter Kuhne, we now have the Circle X letterbox in <br/>
Ventura back in place. I carved a replica stamp from the original <br/>
image and Peter replanted the letterbox and clarified the clues. <br/>
With the cooler weather the hike to this letterbox and beyond is <br/>
much more pleasant. For those interested in letterboxing history <br/>
Lonewolf planted this letterbox on 3/4/99 on a visit to California. <br/>
There was another series planted in June of 99 around the SF area <br/>
but the letterboxes and clues disappeared. If you are interested you <br/>
can go back in the archives of the chat list and find these old <br/>
clues as that is how the clue sheets were originally posted. The Web <br/>
Masters use to do all of the posting for the letterboxers rather <br/>
than the way that they are presently posted by each planter. Next <br/>
time you read something from Jay Drew, you should realize that "He <br/>
was the guy " for California and did all of the inputting for clue <br/>
sheets for us. Jay is a transplanted Californian and it seemed as if <br/>
he would always post our clues quickly. The web Masters did a <br/>
fantastic job(still do) and really don't get the credit due them for <br/>
where the game/hobby is today.<br/>

Well, since you managed to squeeze in something related to Northern<br/>
California, I'll let it slide THIS time....  ;o)<br/>

Well at least I was right up front with it. Has anyone ever tried to <br/>
locate the 1999 series? I think one of the Letterboxes was viable. <br/>
<br/>
Argentina still has no letterboxes. The area I was in reminded me of <br/>
the farm land around Bakersfield, and I figured if someone spent <br/>
much time looking for a letterbox down there they would be sorely <br/>
disappointed.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In looking at the old website, there appear to be a couple of series <br/>
planted from March to July 1999.  When Amanda was here last month and <br/>
we went to get Cranky Donkey, she recognized the area as the same place <br/>
where the "Bol Park" series was located.  In fact, Cranky Donkey was in <br/>
the same fallen oak where box #3 (Snake) of that series had been!  We <br/>
didn't have the 1999 clues with us so we could not double check the <br/>
status of the series, but it is my understanding that they are all <br/>
gone.  I have heard a rumor that one of the 4 from this person's other <br/>
series (The Baylands) might still be intact but I have never looked for <br/>
any of them.  This is in  the same park as Baylands Memories, so if <br/>
anyone goes out there it might be worthwhile to see if any of the old <br/>
boxes still exists.  Amanda, do you have any of the original stamps in <br/>
your book?  Maybe they could be reproduced and revived as well.<br/>
