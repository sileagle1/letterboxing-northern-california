weekend.  Robb and I had a blast.  This was a perfect event.  The<br/>
letterboxes were brilliant, the event stamps glorious, there were<br/>
loads of things to do, but we never felt overwhelmed.  The food was<br/>
delicious. (Who made the chocolate bundt cake? May I have the recipe?)<br/>
 It was so nice to hang out with everyone!<br/>
<br/>
And if you were wondering what I was doing, crawling around under that<br/>
picnic table, you can look at our blog.<br/>

Would anyone be interested in a pumpkin carving min-event?<br/>
