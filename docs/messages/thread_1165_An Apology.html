<br>
I've deleted the event listing for the Santa Clara County Letterbox <br>
Planting Contest.  I had no idea it would ruffle so many feathers, <br>
or that I was doing anything wrong.  I apologize.  <br>
<br>
I was simply trying to motivate more people to plant more boxes in <br>
my neck of the woods.  Apparently I went about it in entirely the <br>
wrong manner.  I guess I just got a little carried away in my <br>
newfound enthusiasm for planting boxes.  I thought it would be a fun <br>
way for Bay Area boxers to "come together" in a joint project that <br>
all could enjoy.  <br>
<br>
But just to clarify...<br>
<br>
I wasn't hoping for people to avoid planting until that date.  <br>
Several members of Team Aahz have boxes in the works that were <br>
scheduled to be planted as soon as they are ready.  I assume others <br>
will plant when they are ready as well.  This was simply an attempt <br>
to motivate.<br>
<br>
I also was not hoping to have random boxes tossed wherever possible <br>
in order to earn a prize.  I assumed the planters would have enough <br>
integrity to think through their boxes and put some genuine effort <br>
into the plants that would bear their name.  I guess I just have too <br>
high an estimation of boxers motivations.  I didn't think the prize <br>
was really that big of a deal.  It's not like I was offering a new <br>
car, and I never considered that people would plant "crap" just to <br>
get some free boxing supplies.<br>
<br>
More than a third of the boxes currently listed in SCC have gone <br>
missing.  Half of Team Aahz is ready to quit boxing as they've only <br>
found one out of seven boxes they've hunted.  This contest helped <br>
motivate them to continue boxing.  The influx of new (read guranteed <br>
not missing) boxes would also have helped boost their spirits as <br>
well.<br>
<br>
Just chalk this whole incident up to another newbie not <br>
understanding his place in the letterboxing hierarchy.  Again I <br>
apologize.  I'll try to run any innovations by those more <br>
experienced than I before implementing them in the future.<br>
