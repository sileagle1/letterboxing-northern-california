Gold Rush Romp.  You all made me feel so welcome, which <br/>
meant a lot to me, since I only discovered letterboxing <br/>
two-and-a-half weeks ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, especially to Cellissimo for kindly allowing me to tag <br/>
along with her.  (And for putting up with my totally unfocused <br/>
lurching-in-all-directions approach to letterboxing...)<br/>
<br/>
I had so much fun, yesterday. I'm in awe of everyone's hard work, <br/>
cleverness, good humor and generosity.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I want to know where everyone gets those unusual <br/>
rubbermaid boxes.  (ArtTrekker, I'm still chuckling over your <br/>
urban garden camoflauge!)<br/>

ps -- if anyone is planning a trip to Cooperstown NY, I'll be <br/>
planting boxes there all summer.  As far as I can tell there aren't <br/>
many 'boxers out that way.<br/>
