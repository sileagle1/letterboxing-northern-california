was in the area, but couldn't find it.<br/>

Oh, &amp; it was my turn to curse your names DoubleSaj &amp; Old Blue, I tried<br/>
for your Best of Davis series Sunday morning.  Unfortunately, there was<br/>
a big marathon in downtown Davis, so I couldn't get to the stores there<br/>
easily.  (&amp; btw, there are 50 letters in the front windows of the Sam<br/>
Spade store if you count all the letters, not just the letters of the<br/>
store name.)  Then I couldn't find the 1st box, so none of the other<br/>
clues made sense.  I think I finally found what I was doing wrong, but<br/>
by then my daughter was hungry &amp; had gotten all wet from playing in the<br/>
grass, so we went home defeated, for now. ;)<br/>

I e-mailed her a couple of weeks ago about what was up with her<br/>
website and she said she was trying to get it back up and working<br/>
properly. I don't think it's a high priority for her, though!<br/>
<br/>
So as I understand it, her boxes are still out there, but the clues<br/>
aren't accessible. (Doesn't mean a couple of the boxes really ARE<br/>
missing, but the lack of clues isn't a good indicator of whether the<br/>
box is missing or not.)<br/>
