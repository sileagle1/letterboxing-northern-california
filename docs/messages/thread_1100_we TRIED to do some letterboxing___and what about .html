                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had the bright idea today to go down to the Aquatic Park in<br/>
Berkeley, and replace a missing stamp.  I've had this new stamp carved<br/>
and ready to go since before Robb's accident, but -- gosh -- things<br/>
somehow got in the way.  I thought that since Robb is doing so well,<br/>
mobility-wise, he and I might take an easy stroll and replace this box.<br/>
<br/>
But darn that weather!  Hard enough to take a stroll with a walker,<br/>
but in the rain we had.  No way.<br/>
<br/>
So, the latest Aquatic Bird will have to hang out in our apartment a<br/>
little longer...<br/>

Does anyone want to decoate Ukrainian Easter Eggs with us in the next<br/>
few weeks?  If you're interested, you had better start eating<br/>
omlettes!  I provide the dyes, and all the tools, but this is a Bring<br/>
Your Own Eggs event! <br/>
<br/>
Drop me a note of you want more information on the EggStravaganza.<br/>

BUT--so glad to hear you were ABLE to get out and about! Sounds like  there's <br/>
real progress going on! So nice to hear. <br/>
<br/>
As for Ukrainian eggs; always wanted to try this lovely artform but  just <br/>
don't have the time. So nice of you to offer though. All you others who  take <br/>
part, ENJOY!  <br/>
