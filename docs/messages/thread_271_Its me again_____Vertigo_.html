Hey everyone my hubby and I went LB this weekend!!!!! WE headed out <br/>
to Geocache (yes I am a Geocacher ) and ended up only doing one LB.   <br/>
We were on our way back from Calistoga and we stopped first to <br/>
do "Not Wine".  Well there was a fee and I couldn't see paying the $8 <br/>
just to find a stamp.  Sorry  :(  Anyway we then went to <br/>
do "Aristocat"  What a great one.  Lovely area and we will be going <br/>
back on a little "Date" just Jeff and I.  Jeff is my hubby.  So <br/>
hopefully this weekend I am off to do Alien is lost.  I reallllly <br/>
want to do this one.  <br/>
Paul???? we watched Vertigo  we have all the answers but 1.  can you <br/>
e-mail me and help me on this?  Let me know Thanks.     Everyone have <br/>
a good week.     M<br/>

Vertigo #3 is well on its way as well.<br/>
<br/>
I've decided to replace the missing Vertigo #1, but will have to modify Parts Two and Three of the clues a bit to reflect a different hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be curious to see who manages to be the first person(s) to solve all three to complete the set!<br/>

<br/>
Two people recently wrote us that they had trouble finding the first Alien<br/>
box. We didn't think it was so difficult to find - but in case it is, it's<br/>
hidden *behind* the middle of three logs if I recall correctly (but don't<br/>
count on my memory), but the hiding spot has an opening from the *front* of<br/>
the log, too, so it could even possibly be seen from the front unless it's<br/>
very well hidden.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy it. It's our first series, and created with a child, so not<br/>
one of the very complex ones - still fun, though! And gorgeous location. I<br/>
hope the weather cooperates with you.<br/>

Hi, my name is Michelle by the way.   Anyhows, I am glad that this one is easy my hubby has a hard time Geocaching because the hiking is to hard on his legs.  he had a disease called Lympthodema.  So this sounds fairly easy.  Thanks also for the extra clue.  I will be sending you a mail letting you know what happens.  Thanks.  M<br/>
