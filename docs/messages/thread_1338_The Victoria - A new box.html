                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Everybody,<br/>
During a recent trip to Texas, I learned that they have a special <br/>
bus that travels around Texas collecting stamps of famous Texans. <br/>
And while discussing the idea at the BASS gathering, I decided to <br/>
launch something similar. So here's the deal:<br/>
<br/>
In 1542 Juan Rodgriquez Cabrillo sailed two ships to Alta <br/>
California. The two ships were the San Salvador and the Victoria. <br/>
Unfortunately the San Salvador sank, however, I have aquired the <br/>
Victoria and have rebuilt her. <br/>
<br/>
She will set sail around California gathering stamps of famous or <br/>
significant Californian's and stamps of items of California <br/>
significant cargo. The Victoria is large, and will accomodate many <br/>
people and lots of cargo. The voyages will be only 7 - 10 days <br/>
therefore people and cargo should be ready to board prior to the <br/>
captain setting sail. <br/>
<br/>
The voyages of the Victoria will only be posted on the Letterboxing <br/>
Northern California and the Letterboxing Southern California groups. <br/>
Please do not post anything about the Victoria anyplace other than <br/>
these two spots. <br/>
<br/>
Once the Victoria has docked another captain may find her, add one <br/>
person and/or one item of cargo and set sail for another port. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not one for many "rules" but I feel compelled to make some up <br/>
just to make the game fair for everybody and to expain how this is <br/>
supposed to work. So here they are:<br/>
<br/>
The Rules of the Victoria<br/>
<br/>
1. The person who picks up the Victoria becomes the Captain. The <br/>
Captain may have co-captains<br/>
<br/>
2. The Captain may allow one person of significance to California to <br/>
board and or one item of cargo to be loaded onto the Victoria. <br/>
Famous Californians also welcome to board. It item of cargo must <br/>
also have some significance to California<br/>
<br/>
3. The Victoria voyages are a maximum of 7 to 10 days from port to <br/>
port. The shorter the voyage time the better.<br/>
<br/>
4. The voyages of the Victoria must be at least 40 miles from port <br/>
to port. The longer the voyage the better.  <br/>
<br/>
5. The Victoria can only be sailed within the State of California. <br/>
Out of State Captains are welcome to sail the Victoria, but the <br/>
Victoria must sail only in California.<br/>
<br/>
6. The Captain may sail the Victoria more than one voyage but not <br/>
consecutive voyages. <br/>
<br/>
7. The Captain will notify other potential captains of the new port <br/>
only on the Letterboxing Northern California and Letterboxing <br/>
Southern California Yahoo Groups. Both groups must be notified <br/>
simultaneously.   No advanced notice to anybody. <br/>
<br/>
8. The Captain will notify when the Victoria has set sail by posting <br/>
on the Letterboxing Northern California and Letterboxing Southern <br/>
California Yahoo Groups.<br/>
<br/>
9. The Captain will hide the Victoria very carefully due to the size <br/>
to ensure the ship's safety.<br/>
<br/>
10. Ports can be anyplace within California. (Not only Oceanside)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So that's it... The Victoria will set sail on it's maiden voyage <br/>
since being rebuilt someplace in Central California in the next 14 <br/>
days. The first passenger to board will be Father Junipero Serra and <br/>
the first item of cargo will be the California Golden Poppy. <br/>

Should we clear with you our choices of Californians and cargo items so there aren't <br/>

I was afraid I wasn't clear. <br/>
<br/>
The Victoria travels by the captain's vehicle from port to port. (no  mail)<br/>
<br/>
The new port is where ever the captain decides it can be hidden well. It  can <br/>
be existing LB spot or a new spot. (it's pretty big)<br/>
<br/>
All the rubber stamps of the passengers and cargo stay in the Victoria for  <br/>
future Captains to stamp into their log books. That's why the Victoria is <br/>
large,  to hold the  rubber stamps. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, As the captain you will stamp the log book too.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it is necessary to clear your passenger and cargo with me.  <br/>
Maybe when it sets sail the captain can tell the group 1. that it has set sail,  <br/>
and 2. Who and what has boarded.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see the actual Texas Bus, but I saw some of the passenger stamps  in <br/>
Puddle Splasher's log book. It was famous Texas such as sport stars,  <br/>
historical characters, etc.  It's totally a LB thing, <br/>
<br/>
Hope that clears it up. <br/>
