Since there is several folks that count everything from F,P,X, to <br/>
various animals observed on the letterboxing hunt, should there be a <br/>
TL count?<br/>

Hmm....  Not sure.  What's TL stand for?  Turtle?  =)<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of funny, but I never really counted anything but PFXE and <br/>
considered counting HH separately since they're definitely a class <br/>
very different than the typical finds.  But when I started hiking the <br/>
AT, I started counting all the snakes, turtles, lizards, bears, <br/>
moose, and anything else I typically saw, on average, once a week or <br/>
less.  I ended up losing count of the snakes and turtles by <br/>
Pennsylvania (somewhere north of 10--out of fingers and I can't count <br/>
anymore!)  Lizards were surprisingly uncommon--at least compared to <br/>
California--and I never really had the heart for counting anything as <br/>
mundane as a lizard.  Although I have to admit, it was fun seeing <br/>
some freaking looking lizards instead of the usual western fence <br/>
lizard that's so common in California.  Bears and moose: I saw five <br/>
bears and two moose.  In the wild, at least.  If you count bears seen <br/>
in captivity in the Bear Mountain Zoo (which the trail does go <br/>
through!) you can add two more to that count.  Then there was another <br/>
circus bear I saw in North Woodstock, New Hampshire, but it was <br/>
actually located about five miles off the the trail so I definitely <br/>
don't think that one should count.<br/>
<br/>
But I digress....  what does TL stand for?  =)<br/>

Gwen and I generally keep count in our own records for P,F, and X so that we can try to stay even or atleast close to even on the P &amp;F. This year I could have really increased my rattler count big time. Earlier this year I killed a nasty little 12 incher about 30 feet from our front door ,and just last week while chasing Quail I came across two huge rattlers within 20 minutes of each other. I vowed not to hunt that area until it gets a lot colder.Don<br/>

<br/>
What?!  You mean my Bomb's Away letterbox?!  I didn't realize you two <br/>
nabbed that box!  Which is actually in Oregon, not California, but <br/>
it's so close to the border you could practically spit into <br/>
California if the wind is blowing in the right direction, so who <br/>
cares?  =)<br/>
<br/>
But to see a black bear too?!  Sheeze, I saw a black bear driving <br/>
back down from that road too!  And I got a report from somebody else <br/>
who had also seen a black bear on that road while getting the <br/>
letterbox.  Wait a minute--that wasn't you guys that told me that, is <br/>
it?  Hmm...  Maybe you did tell me about finding that box.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it does seem to be an especially good place to spot <br/>
black bears since everyone that goes out there for the box seems to <br/>
see one.  (Who'd have thought?)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm done....  =)<br/>
