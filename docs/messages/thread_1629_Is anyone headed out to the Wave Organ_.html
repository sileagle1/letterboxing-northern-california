rectangular like an Altoids tin, or more square.  I do remember the<br>
stamp was rectangular, probably 1.5" by 3".<br>

geotrashed -- twice! So be it -- or "Let it Be".<br>
<br>
I've been looking at the "Sound Waves" clues, and even with knowing<br>
that location very well -- I can't seem to narrow the EXACT spot down.<br>
I think there are about 20 - 35 little spots to hide an Altoids box there.<br>
So I haven't gone to look for it yet.<br>
<br>
Besides, my job as Curator of the Cabinet of Curiosities keeps me<br>
busy, and I've always been 85% Planter and 15% Finder.<br>
