We picked it up in the "River's Ho" box this weekend.  It is our<br/>
second time for this little HH.  Others that have had it twice are<br/>
Princess Lea, Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue, artTrekker and Izzy.  We would<br/>
have left it in the River's Ho box for someone else to carry but did<br/>
not think that the box would get much traffic this time of year so<br/>
will try to get him off to a good and long flight this time.  BTW, is<br/>
anyone heading out of state any time soon?  If so, and you are willing<br/>
to take this HH, please contact us, otherwise, we will do our<br/>
"derndest" to move him as far as possible. <br/>

Hi Carole,<br/>
<br/>
I hope you had a nice visit with your family. I missed you!<br/>
<br/>
I could take Golden Goose to Oregon or Washington &amp; maybe that would be a good way to move it along. I'd also like to get my hands on a few more of those great Korean boxes before I head north. Maybe I'll call you in the morning.<br/>
