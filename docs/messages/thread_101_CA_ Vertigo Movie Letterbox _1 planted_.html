you're a fan of Hitchcock and Vertigo, you'll plummet head over high <br>
heels for this one! It's the first of three planned Vertigo boxes, <br>
each more diabolical than the one before. <br>
<br>
Princess Lea herself was gracious enough to do some testing on my <br>
clues, and here's what she had to say: "OOOH, THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN!  <br>
You are as clever as they come. I was honored to be the guinea pig."<br>
<br>
Many thanks to Princess Lea for her help and inspiration. We're <br>
plotting a collaborative letterbox for the near future... That <br>
should scare you!<br>
<br>
So, here's the link to Vertigo Letterbox #1, a trip into the <br>
illusions of the past, to follow an evil plot of deceit! Beware! And <br>
watch your step!<br>

Oh, that's too funny.  You know, that would make a great addition <br>
to 'movie themed' letterboxes--including positive quotes about what <br>
other people had to say about finding your box.  =)<br>

Umm...  I just realized that this probably doesn't sound good.  I <br>
did NOT mean to imply that Princess Lea looked like a slug!  Rather, <br>
I was thinking she'd make a great hero that defeats the evil slugs!  <br>

I figure that if you want traffic to your box, then some marketing <br>
is needed. And just like commercials, I've got a celebrity <br>
endorsement (and unpaid)! <br>
<br>
Of course, I could get the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock to say a few <br>
words, but he says plenty enough in my clues. Alfred & I are already <br>
at work on Vertigo Letterbox #2, and I'll tell you, he does get a <br>
bit fussy and pushy at times.<br>

Very resourceful, you are.  I can tell you'll be going far in this <br>
hobby.  =)  My favorite boxes tend to be the 'innovative' ones--<br>
witty, clever, unquie--and I have a hunch you'll be hiding a lot of <br>
them.<br>
