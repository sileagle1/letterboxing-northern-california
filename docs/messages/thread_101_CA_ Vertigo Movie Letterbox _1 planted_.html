                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hooray! Got my first letterbox planted in San Francisco, and if <br/>
you're a fan of Hitchcock and Vertigo, you'll plummet head over high <br/>
heels for this one! It's the first of three planned Vertigo boxes, <br/>
each more diabolical than the one before. <br/>
<br/>
Princess Lea herself was gracious enough to do some testing on my <br/>
clues, and here's what she had to say: "OOOH, THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN!  <br/>
You are as clever as they come. I was honored to be the guinea pig."<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Princess Lea for her help and inspiration. We're <br/>
plotting a collaborative letterbox for the near future... That <br/>
should scare you!<br/>
<br/>
So, here's the link to Vertigo Letterbox #1, a trip into the <br/>
illusions of the past, to follow an evil plot of deceit! Beware! And <br/>
watch your step!<br/>

Oh, that's too funny.  You know, that would make a great addition <br/>
to 'movie themed' letterboxes--including positive quotes about what <br/>
other people had to say about finding your box.  =)<br/>

I figure that if you want traffic to your box, then some marketing <br/>
is needed. And just like commercials, I've got a celebrity <br/>
endorsement (and unpaid)! <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I could get the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock to say a few <br/>
words, but he says plenty enough in my clues. Alfred &amp; I are already <br/>
at work on Vertigo Letterbox #2, and I'll tell you, he does get a <br/>
bit fussy and pushy at times.<br/>

Very resourceful, you are.  I can tell you'll be going far in this <br/>
hobby.  =)  My favorite boxes tend to be the 'innovative' ones--<br/>
witty, clever, unquie--and I have a hunch you'll be hiding a lot of <br/>
them.<br/>
