I just received an email from "lisascenic" on Atlasquest wondering if a <br/>
newbie like herself would be welcome to attend the GRR. I assurred her <br/>
that anyone who could post her very first clue as intreguing as the one <br/>
she did yesterday wasn't going to be a newbie for long!! She asked if <br/>
anyone lived in the Oakland area was attending the gathering so she <br/>
could carpool.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone? Contact her through AtlasQuest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

I didn't want to broadcast her email address and thought anyone interested <br/>
could find her on Atlasquest, as I did. I also suggested to her that she look on <br/>
LbNCA but since she's a Newbie, didn't know if she'd know how.<br/>

I'm hoping that someone might allow me to ride along with them <br/>
from the East Bay to the upcoming letterboxers' shin-dig.  I'll help <br/>
with the cost of gas, tell silly stories, and generally act in awe of <br/>
you grizzled old-timers.  (That's my lame attempt at sounding like <br/>
a greenhorn-gold miner-western-something or other...)<br/>
