return to the letterboxing life again soon.<br/>
<br/>
While we were moving in we used some of the plastic utensils, plates <br/>
and cups we had leftover from the two letterbox gatherings we attended <br/>
this past summer.  Imagine our surprise when we lifted a plastic glass <br/>
to discover a letterbox cootie nestled underneath.  It had been hidden <br/>
during the BASS in Oakland and remained undiscovered throughout the <br/>
Vacaville event.<br/>
<br/>
We consider it a welcome reminder of some of our good boxing friends.  <br/>
We had planned to take it to the Tucson gathering last week, but <br/>
illness kept us home.  Who knows.  Maybe it will reappear in San <br/>
Diego - or on April Fools Day!  We warned; be alert; be stealthy.  :-)<br/>
