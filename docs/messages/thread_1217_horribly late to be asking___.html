between Richmond and Point Reyes?  <br/>
<br/>
We're still trying to letterbox, which is such a challenge considering<br/>
how little Robb is able to walk.<br/>
<br/>
I planted.....mmmmmm.....something today, but I'm trying to get the<br/>
clues in place!<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget that there's a new piece at Berkeley Rep..  I'm probably<br/>
going to retire this series for the summer, and then start again when<br/>
the season starts up again in September.  But I may get busy and leave<br/>
the stuff out there...<br/>
