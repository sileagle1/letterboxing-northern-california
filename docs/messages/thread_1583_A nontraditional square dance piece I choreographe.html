<br/>
  We watched it and thought it was wonderful!  <br/>
<br/>
  It reminded me a bit of my husband's grandfather-- so many years ago, he was a folk dancing afficianado, and as time went by he used to re-choreograph traditional folk dances.  This was when he lived in a retirement community and the women far outnumbered the men, so instead of just couples, he re-worked them so that he would be dancing with several of the widowed ladies all at once---  That was quite lovely too in its own way...<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for sharing with us Paul!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks! In its own way, the piece has shaken up the square dance world <br/>
a bit, since it's a new genre. I've been calling it "expressive or <br/>
lyrical square dance". <br/>
Normally, square dancing is a left brain activity. Dancers are at the <br/>
mercy of the caller. Brains are busy processing the calls on the spot <br/>
as they are announced by the caller. That makes 'flow' and expression <br/>
difficult, as dancers rush to complete each call before the next one <br/>
is called out.<br/>
Originally, there was no caller. People learned and knew whole dances. <br/>
The caller came into play in the 1950s, when folks started being more <br/>
mobile. Regionalism kept people from Virginia from dancing with people <br/>
from Utah. Plus, new amplified sound speakers allowed callers to be <br/>
heard.<br/>
Then in stepped a standardization committee, with definitions &amp; rules, <br/>
and levels of dance, etc. Now nothing happens without a (paid) caller. <br/>
Yes, paid.<br/>
<br/>
By replacing the caller with learned choreography, I shifted the whole <br/>
equation. A couple of callers have accused me of trying to "bring down <br/>
the institution of square dance" by doing nonstandard pieces!!!<br/>
<br/>
But the dancers like it -- and next Sunday, I'm putting together a <br/>
totally improvisational piece called, "The Circle Dance for Square <br/>
Dancers"! How subversive!!!<br/>
<br/>
P.S. You never know...there might one day be a letterbox that's based <br/>
on square dance calls...<br/>
