<br/>
On Saturday, the lot of us Alien Explorers trekked out to Sugar Loaf park<br/>
and did the Planet Walk letterboxing series Mimulus had just completed. The<br/>
youngest member of our exploration team was quite thrilled with the first<br/>
finder prizes. And we were all amazed by the whole series. Get this: 11<br/>
boxes! Each one is a lovely stamp in a great location, and the hike is<br/>
beautiful. We spent several hours there what with the hiking, looking, and<br/>
stamping. Mimulus, our hats off to you!<br/>
<br/>
In gratitude, I planted a box along that same walk in Mimulus' honor, for<br/>
which the clues might be placed somewhere or another some time or another<br/>
(hopefully soon).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Mimulus!<br/>
<br/>
