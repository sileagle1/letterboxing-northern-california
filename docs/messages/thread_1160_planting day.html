                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've been watching this whole discussion unfold on the wider listserves and messageboards.  As newbies, we figured people really didn't want to hear from us.  We're in Santa Clara County, and on May 24, we'll be at work for most of the day.  But one cannot avoid the first National Planting Day!  So we will have something to plant (or post).  As for a contest for most planted, we've been cruising along planting quite a few, and now we need people to come find them.  (Although it would be nice to have more boxes down here to find -- it's no fun hunting for your own boxes.)  So holiday?  Great!  Contest?  It's your choice.  <br/>

WHAT?!?!?!?!  ARE YOU KIDDING?!?!?!?!<br/>
<br/>
New blood brings new ideas!  New ideas keep things fresh and creative.<br/>
 I can't speak for anyone other than myself, of course, but I think<br/>
we're always thrilled when we start hearing from someone new.<br/>
<br/>
The national discussion boards are, to my mind, not indicitive of the<br/>
spirit of the letterboxers I know.  The letterboxers I've met are fun,<br/>
generous, and intereseted in experiencing new twists on letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Let's hear those fresh ideas!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We will spend May 24th flying back to California from the East <br/>
Coast.  We enjoy planting letterboxes in many sites whenever the <br/>
opportunity arises.  We don't feel the necessity of planting on a <br/>
certain day with everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if May 24th encourages others to begin placing <br/>
letterboxes, great!  <br/>
<br/>
We have found a box or two of yours and look forward to finding <br/>
others in the future.  After we relocate to San Jose later this <br/>
summer, we intend to add to the "planted" count down there.  <br/>
