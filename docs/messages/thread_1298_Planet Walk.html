If there is, trust me, you're not the only one so afflicted. :-)<br>
<br>
This issue is a big one here in Ithaca, home of the Carl Sagan Planet Walk <br>
(Sagan was a Cornell professor). It even made front page news in our local <br>
paper today, a nice change considering that we've had three deaths in our <br>
gorges in the last two weeks, which make for rather sad headlines.<br>

<br>
I know at least two of us Ithaca area letterboxers have considered creating <br>
a letterbox series based on the scale model planet walk. Maybe we'll wait <br>
to see what happens, or else make our own continuation of the planet walk <br>
based on new planetary additions!<br>
<br>
For any of you who might be visiting Ithaca soon, you can now download a <br>
podcast of Bill Nye (you know, the Science Guy) narrating the planet walk <br>
as you travel from the Sun on the Ithaca Commons to Pluto at our <br>
Sciencenter. He was a visiting professor here for a few years and recorded <br>
the podcast during his final official visit a couple of months ago. Cool stuff!<br>

TurtleMcQ, now thinking about other science/letterboxing connections...<br>
