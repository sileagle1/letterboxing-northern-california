                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone --<br>
<br>
I have SO MUCH to tell you all, I hardly know where to begin.  Firstly <br>
I survived the Planet Walk/Gray Pine experience!  Thanks to everyone <br>
who got me prepared/psyched up for those hills.  I cannot believe <br>
Mimulus does it voluntarily on a regular basis.  We got there at 11:00 <br>
and got back to the parking lot at 5:30 - 6 1/2 hours!  But keep in <br>
mind that it took me an hour and half just to go the 1,000 feet to Mars <br>
due to all the stamping in I had to do (there were HHs involved to <br>
complicate everything).  Although it never rained very hard, there were <br>
some small showers and constant drizzle up on the ridge.  John had the <br>
brilliant idea of bringing along a folding chair which came in very <br>
handy when the other option was sitting in the mud to stamp in.  We <br>
were fully equipped with umbrellas, food, flashlights and a cell phone. <br>
Unfortunately, like aT and H. Amadeus, we missed Pluto on the way back. <br>
  I think it must have been where the trail splits and there are no <br>
markers - and we made the wrong choice.  Otherwise we got everything <br>
and got back to our B&B dirty and exhausted, but quite smug!<br>
<br>
The most harrowing part of the adventure was when we had to cross the <br>
creek to get to Gray Pine - as you all know it has been raining a lot <br>
and so the creek was running high.  We had to take our shoes and socks <br>
off to ford the thing (the water came up almost to my knees!) and then <br>
had to do it again when you cross the creek the second time.<br>
<br>
I'm sending the SitReps on the other areas I travelled to separately so <br>
they can be found more easily in the future.  Over the 4-day weekend I <br>
ended up with F38 P2 (+ replanted 2) and should have got X3 except the <br>
people didn't have their stamps.  22 of the Fs were Mimulus's!<br>

Congratulations Princess Lea and family!!  Sounds like you got an<br>
enviable amount of stamps for a week-end and it seems like you made<br>
great time on the Sugarloaf loop, and in nasty weather at that.  Now<br>
tell me how this compares to Blackbirds Oakland Hills series.  Can we<br>
do it?<br>
<br>
I think that everyone that does the loop from Gray Pine misses Pluto.<br>
<br>
We missed it the first time, the Boxalots, artTrekker and Healdsburg<br>
Amadeus and perhaps there were others.<br>
<br>
My advice to anyone that is reading this and may be planning to do<br>
this combination series loop keep in mind that even though that hill<br>
ahead seems to be the straw that will break the camels back and very<br>
possibly yours as well, you have to take it to get Pluto.  Any time<br>
you have the opportunity to take the path of least resistance, don't!<br>
Do not veer left!!  It's always up,up, up and over!!!  But, don't let<br>
all of this talk scare you from getting these series.  These are all<br>
great stamps and it is a beautiful area and worth the pain.  smile<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm laughing.... cause I couldn't quite face the huge hill to Pluto when we<br>
went up there (we were first finders). I started it, but realized there was<br>
a big "should" in there, and chose instead to go back to the picnic table<br>
and finish Abamit and her Shadow. My partner and 6 year old son braved the<br>
hill and made it - and there was a surprise there! The way down, they<br>
reported, was harder than the way up.<br>
<br>
So you can follow my example: send a different member of your party up<br>
there....<br>

Personally I had ore difficulty with the Oakland boxes, but that is <br>
probably because I was still a little sick at the time, and also <br>
because I was not mentally prepared for the challenge.  Had both those <br>
things corrected when I got to Sugarloaf, so I think that if you made <br>
it through that one stretch between boxes 4 and 5 for Gray Pine, you <br>
would probably survive Who Goes There.<br>

So, you are saying it was back where the trail splits off to the actual <br>
Brushy Peak?  That means it actually leaves the trail, at least <br>
according to my map.  That's why I didn't go up there!  There was <br>
another place where the trail divided, and that's where I thought I <br>
missed Pluto (that time I went up, instead of taking the side route).  <br>
Sorry, but I AIN'T going back for Pluto!<br>
