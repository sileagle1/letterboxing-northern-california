Thank you for all the suggestions for wonderful boxes.  I think bugZ <br>
hit it on the nose for me.... I am a collector of fun clues.  With the <br>
price of gasoline and limited free time sometimes reading about boxes <br>
has to substitute for the trail experience.  <br>
<br>
As for hitchhikers, I am delighted to find them in a box, but do not <br>
always take them with me.  Especially if they are big...I carried one <br>
around for 3 months before I finally just started a new box myself <br>
that was big enough to hold the HH and the regular stuff.  It seems HH <br>
that originate on the EAst Coast are larger than ones coming from the <br>
WEst....has anyone else noticed that?  OF course, I am pretty new to <br>
all this, perhaps I will feel differently  a few years down the road.  <br>
<br>
One of the things I like about letterboxing is gettign communication <br>
from finders so I do not mind emailing the owner of a HH, what goes <br>
round comes round.  <br>
<br>
SO what about a wintertime carving demo the first weekend of february.<br>
....it may be our last chance to visit with Tara.  I again offer my <br>
house in Sonoma County but perhaps a more central location in the SF <br>
or East Bay to accomadate more folk.<br>
