                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, GGP is San Francisco city land, and was developed out of sand dunes for the Winter Exposition, when the Japanese Tea Garden was created -- the only area near is Ocean Beach which is under the jurisdiction of the National Recreation Area. Since it is a multi-use recreational area that includes polo, flyfishing, motorized miniature yachting, golf, lawn bowling, and lots more, I think the tiny spaces held by letterboxes would go ignored and (hopefully) unnoticed by the understaffed park maintenance team. We should, however, be sensitive to the areas of the park that are being re-planted or areas such as the Arboretum, Shakespeare Garden, Tea Garden and the AIDS Grove, so as to not disturb fragile plants.<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that GG Park is larger than Central Park, and some areas are quite distant. It's also quite possible to lose your sense of direction while in the park. While doing some maintenance on a box currently in the park for a friend, I ended up walking an exhausting long distance in the wrong direction, because I was accidentally turned around. (I WAS carrying my compass, and didn't even bother to check, because I was certain I was heading in the correct direction). Advice: take a map of the Park and a compass, and use both of them.<br>
<br>
For those people intending to add to the "I Left My Heart" series, and wish to honor a place in the G Gate Park, please keep the above in mind, even if you're not planning to attend the gathering.<br>
<br>
See you at the Golden Gate Gathering!<br>

Can do! If you ever head out to Pleasanton/Livermore or Fremont/ <br>
Union City area to hunt for some boxes then you could meet a boxer <br>
face-to-face(Bookworm is wicked with her kicks, but the rest of us <br>
are really harmless). Just e-mail Lizardbutt and family, we'll try to <br>
meet up with you. <br>
<br>
We're looking forward to the gathering. I'll have to do some research <br>
so that I can leave a box for "I Left My Heart" series. The kids are <br>
due for their fix of Ghirardelli chocolate and cabel car rides-just <br>
love those vistas.<br>
