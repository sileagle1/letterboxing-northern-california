afternoon.  From Highway 12 go east through Rio Vista and pass the 160 <br>
turnoff.  Soon, as you approach the Jackson Slough Road you will see a <br>
red, white, and blue sign high above on the right that says:<br>
<- This Exit<br>
Delta Loop<br>
10 Mile Scenic Drive<br>
<br>
Turn right (south) onto Jackson Slough Road.  Drive close to 2 miles <br>
to a T stop.  Turn left onto Brannan Island Road.  Drive about 1 1/2 <br>
miles.  Just past mile post #6 on your left will be the entrance to <br>
the Delta Bay Club.<br>
<br>
These are levee roads, 2 lanes on elevated roads surrounded by <br>
farmlands.  Enjoy the view and drive carefully!<br>
<br>
See you all on July 9th.<br>
