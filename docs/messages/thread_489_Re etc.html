Hi to all our LB pals from up here in the Great White North! <br/>
<br/>
To add our 2 cents worth - we found our first box on 3 Aug 03 (Don <br/>
and Gwen's Dam Raccoon in Oroville) and picked up F100 at Chowder's <br/>
Marina Pacifica Plumbing problem in Long Beach on 18 Jan 04. <br/>
<br/>
All but 1 box were in the state of CA - the other was the fantastic <br/>
Incline Village box in NV, and were done, like Doublesaj, at a time <br/>
when there weren't a whole lotta boxes up in the northern part of <br/>
the state.<br/>
<br/>
We're amused to see the difference from Right to Left Coast - Wanda <br/>
and Pete picked up 130 boxes in 4 DAYS in CT - and we picked up 54 <br/>
boxes in 3 days in NY!<br/>
<br/>
Now, up here in ON it's a different story - might take a while to <br/>
get F100 here as there are currently only 67 boxes in the province <br/>
and most of those are under 3 feet of snow (the others are under <br/>
only 2 feet lol!) We've planted a few, with a bunch more ready to go <br/>
in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
We'll go back to lurking now!!<br/>
