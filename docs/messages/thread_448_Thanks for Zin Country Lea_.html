I see Zin Country was posted, and Angel Wine.  Now I really need to <br/>
make a road trip.  But not now....leaving for East coast 70th <br/>
birthday party. Looking foward to my return to soggy N CA to go out <br/>
boxing, hopefully I can bring some sun (said on the eleventh <br/>
consecultive day of rain in Santa Rosa.)<br/>
<br/>
Great carving work too, I bet.  Thanks Lea, I don't know how you <br/>
find the time.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's my pleasure!  It was also a nice respite from replanting all my <br/>
missing boxes - it's boring when your P count is stagnant.  Mim already <br/>
knows what the Zin stamp will look like (approximately), but I have to <br/>
say I am quite pleased with the way it turned out.  However, don't <br/>
expect any more new boxes from this student nurse until spring is over. <br/>
  Speaking of which, I for one vote to keep the Sacto gathering on April <br/>
30th - it slips in perfectly between my semesters, and I would not be <br/>
able to attend if it was the following weekend, and that would be very <br/>
mean to snatch it from my expectant grasp.  Congratulations on finding <br/>
the Wide Window box aT!  I am JELL-US!<br/>

P.S.  Mim, are you going anywhere where they might have boxes?<br/>
