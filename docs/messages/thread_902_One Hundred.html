It helped that when I started, I was really obsessed, and that Robb<br/>
was in a show that I wasn't interested in seeing more than once.  I<br/>
had a stretch of weekends free to hunt letterboxes.  The Gold Rush<br/>
Romp greatly added to my count.  I'm still learning the Bay Area, so<br/>
our usual weekend exploring combines nicely with letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really not a "counter" so it is funny that the day I decided to<br/>
tally, I actually had hit an even hundred.  I'm somewhat of a bird<br/>
watcher, but don't count that either.  <br/>
<br/>
The one thing I do count is deer, but only during the period of the<br/>
year that I'm working at Glimmerglass Opera.  My dear friend and<br/>
co-worker, Sheila, and I have a silly deer-counting contest.  She<br/>
takes it much further than I....and keeps three tallies: live, dead,<br/>
and stuffed.  I can't figure out the fractions on the taxedermy.  I've<br/>
"busted" her for counting hay bales and archery targets, though!<br/>

I passed my 300 mark on this trip (still not home!), and what's very fun is that the day I was at Hog Heaven--September 16--was my one year anniversary! Nils, it just takes time &amp; travel, two things that must be hard to come by when you have little ones.<br/>
