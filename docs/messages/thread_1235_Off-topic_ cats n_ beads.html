<br/>
This is a completely off topic post, but as we are all craft-oriented<br/>
here, I thought some of you might appreciate this:<br/>
<br/>
There is a bead artist named Anne Choi who works in silver.  She<br/>
hand-carves beads in clay and casts them in limited numbers.  Her beads<br/>
are hollow and range from 3/4" high to 2 1/2" high, light to wear but<br/>
eye-catching, with holes for stringing.  Her subjects are nature, and<br/>
words; she often combines a thoughtful quote with an floral or faunal<br/>
subject.  She just posted a new batch of beads, including a few with cats!<br/>
 Her work is so beautiful (I have been a collector for years) and I always<br/>
get a million compliments when I'm wearing one of her pieces.<br/>
<br/>
I get no commission or anything for mentioning this here, and she's not a<br/>
personal friend - just someone that I, especially as an amateur<br/>
silversmith and jeweler, really admire and find inspiring.  I thought you<br/>
crafty and cat-adoring folks (I suspect more than a few of you here are<br/>
owned by some felines!) would enjoy her work.<br/>
<br/>
Her site is at http://www.annechoi.com.  I hope you like it as much as I<br/>
do! :)<br/>
