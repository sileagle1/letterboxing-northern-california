We zoomed out and nabbed your new box last Friday.  While the parking lot wasn't packed at the time...there were two sheriff's deputies hanging out at the turn in to the Museum.  We had to be extra stealthy!  My favorite - ha!<br>
 <br>
The Halloween train rides are a big hit - as are the Christmas train rides later this season!<br>
 <br>
Thanks for planting something close to home!  <br>
 <br>
Take care, The Boxalots<br>
