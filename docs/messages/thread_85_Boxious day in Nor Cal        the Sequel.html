     Great Minds think alike. We did just about the same loop the <br>
next day. We added 6 including the Hope HH to our Found list <br>
yesterday (4/4/4) We did Auburn, Grass Valley, Rough and Ready and <br>
Bridgeport. Missed Yuba City this time. Plus we planted 2 more. Saw <br>
your stamps everyplace we went.  <br>
<br>
Tell me what the V18 A18 HH 7 mean??? I think I might be counting <br>
wrong.<br>
Thanks<br>
