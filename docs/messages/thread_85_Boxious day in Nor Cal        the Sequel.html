     Great Minds think alike. We did just about the same loop the <br/>
next day. We added 6 including the Hope HH to our Found list <br/>
yesterday (4/4/4) We did Auburn, Grass Valley, Rough and Ready and <br/>
Bridgeport. Missed Yuba City this time. Plus we planted 2 more. Saw <br/>
your stamps everyplace we went.  <br/>
<br/>
Tell me what the V18 A18 HH 7 mean??? I think I might be counting <br/>
wrong.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; We added 7 boxes to our F count and 1 HH today in this beautiful <br/>
75 degree <br/>
&gt; weather. This 'loop' of boxes we made is a good one, taking us <br/>
from Yuba City, <br/>
&gt; up to Grass Valley then over to Folsom. We highly recommend it!! <br/>
Here's a <br/>
&gt; status report:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bok Kai--first finders<br/>
&gt; Ruff &amp; Ready--a wedding in progress culminating with the honking <br/>
of horns<br/>
&gt;     as we got the second box was a real bonus to these cute <br/>
stamps. For<br/>
&gt;     anyone who watched the Ruff &amp; Ready cartoons as a kid, you <br/>
won't be <br/>
&gt;     able to get that darned theme song out of your head!!<br/>
&gt; Bridgeport-- what an interesting place and a great, big stamp! <br/>
This is the <br/>
&gt;     longest covered bridge in the U.S.!!<br/>
&gt; (These stamps are all by the Jiggs Family and are really great <br/>
boxes!)<br/>
&gt; Empire Mine--planted by Funhog in 2001, this is a great historic <br/>
location for <br/>
&gt;     a day of discovery and a lovely picnic.<br/>
&gt; Folsom "Castle Park" Series--in the over-built town of Folsom, a <br/>
man-made<br/>
&gt;     wetlands any birdlover would adore houses these 3 boxes <br/>
beautifully <br/>
&gt;     carved by a newbie, Diana. Don't miss these!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy boxing!!<br/>
