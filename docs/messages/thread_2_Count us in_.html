how really kooky we are out here on the left coast! (My theory is, <br/>
it's caused by too much sunshine) So, I'll try very hard NOT to say <br/>
anything that might offend any of those West Virginians or <br/>
Tennesseeans. . .<br/>

Are there actually any letterboxers from West Virginia or Tennessee?  <br/>
I'll admit to hiding some in those states, but I was just passing <br/>
through which is how I think most of those boxes were created!<br/>
