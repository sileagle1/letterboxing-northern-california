                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found the box hidden in Nisene Marks state park yesterday; we had <br/>
to pay the $6 "day use" fee to get in. In looking at the letterboxes <br/>
we're considering looking for next weekend, there are a couple more <br/>
that are in state parks, with similar fees. I noticed on the state <br/>
parks website an annual pass can be purchased for $125 and it's good <br/>
at most of the state parks (but not all.) I was wondering if any <br/>
other letterboxers have purchased this and whether you thought it was <br/>
worth it, or if you had any problems using it?<br/>
