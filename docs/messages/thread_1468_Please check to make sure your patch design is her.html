<br/>
Below is the link to the page with the patches that Mark received for <br/>
our contest.  At least one person on the SoCal board says she sent in a <br/>
design that isn't on this page, so Mark didn't get it for whatever <br/>
reason.  She's going to send it again and Mark is going to add it to <br/>
the page and set the voting back to zero (so don't bother voting right <br/>
now, because it will just get erased).  I just want everyone here who <br/>
sent in a design to check and see if it's on this page and if it's not <br/>
to send it to Mark again ASAP.<br/>
