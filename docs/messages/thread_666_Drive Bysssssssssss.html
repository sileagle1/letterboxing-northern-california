Hi everyone, gee I miss this board.  I have gotten into the Postal <br/>
letterboxes since I can't seem to find any easy LB  's to find. Jeff <br/>
can't do the long hikes and almost everyone that looks interesting to <br/>
us is long hikes.  :( Anyone out there know of some easy drive bys?  WE <br/>
still plan on do the Lemony Snicket one (BTW you can buy to own Next <br/>
Tuesday)with Jeff probably limping slowly behind.  Sure hope evryone <br/>
has fun at the GGR next week.  Sure wish we could attend but we have to <br/>
wait for the next one.  Michelle<br/>

Hi Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming that you are some where north of us, but if you want to <br/>
head to Kernville for a few days I think we could get a list together <br/>
for some very short hike or drive by boxes.  <br/>

Well if you head south on 680 to 580, turn south on 5, switch to 58 to <br/>
Bakersfield, then jump on 178 past Lake Isabella it is in the <br/>
neighborhood of 300 miles give or take 50 miles or so.<br/>

Good grief!  Giving the directions to Seattle would be simplier than<br/>
that!  Take I-80 to Sacramento, run up I-5 to Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, admittedly the drive is a bit longer, but the directions are<br/>
easier!!!  =)<br/>

But isn't following complex instructions one of the joyful challenges <br/>
of letterboxing, second only to deciphering clues?  Bring on the <br/>
complexities!!!<br/>
