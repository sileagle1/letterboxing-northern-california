We received the nicest email today from a Letterboxer in North <br/>
Carolina who grew up in Lodi.  He is bringing his family back to <br/>
Lodi for the holidays.  He said he just checked to see if there were <br/>
any letterboxes in the area, and wrote to thank us for placing some <br/>
around here.  He wants to share the letterboxing experience with his <br/>
parents as well as his kids.  Does it get any better than this?  If <br/>
you have placed any boxes anywhere, consider yourselves thanked!<br/>

No so grumpy anymore, huh?  ;o)<br/>

Hey, it's the Grinch's favorite time of year coming up!  It would be<br/>
really cool if you hid a Grinch-themed box or series....<br/>
<br/>
Not that I'll be in the area anytime soon to look for them, but the<br/>

Thanks for the idea, Ryan.  We happen to have 3 hand-carved Grumpy <br/>
Grinch stamps.  We vary them when we stamp in depending upon the <br/>
size of the receiving logbook.  If we can find the perfect hiding <br/>
place, maybe we will place one in a letterbox.  We will certainly <br/>
let you all know if and when that happens.<br/>

We've been off line for awhile...and our computer is<br/>
still down...but...<br/>
<br/>
Sierra Sally - yes, we will help with the gathering in<br/>
Old Sac....<br/>
<br/>
And in regards to Grumpy Grinch and a series of<br/>
boxes...maybe we should follow in the vein of the<br/>
Mansfield Monster Mash and create a Sacrameno<br/>
Sprintime with Seuss Gathering???  I'm sure we could<br/>
welcome Seuss stamps from all over!?  What do you<br/>
think???<br/>
<br/>
Take care, BugZ<br/>
