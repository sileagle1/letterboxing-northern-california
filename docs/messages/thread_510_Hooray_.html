My husband told me that he wants to start letterboxing with me!!  I <br>
can't believe it, I've been trying to get him interested for MONTHS.  <br>
He says he might even carve a stamp and start hiding boxes.  Only, <br>
his boxes will be very "green turtle"-ish, in that he swears they <br>
will all be either ten mile hikes or you'll have to swim to them. I <br>
said to him "whatever you want as long as you start boxing with <br>
me!".  Now we're thinking up a trail name for him...for some reason <br>
I'm having a tough time with it.  I've alread thought of great names <br>
for a few other people (who don't box yet :P thats the next step!), <br>
but am having such a hard time with my husband.  Yeah, and I really <br>
haven't picked a trail name yet either.  We can be the noname family <br>
or something :P<br>
Anyway, hopefully you'll see some more boxes and a new stamp out <br>
there!<br>

Since we all already know you as "Tara", why not take that a step <br>
further... you can be "Rhett" and "Scarlett"!<br>

Funny you should post this--I was just perusing Tara's website for <br>
clues for our upcoming 'rim to rim trip' through CA and saw a <br>
picture of her husband.  I instantly assumed he was a member of the <br>
Corps!  Now, some 45 minutes later somebody confirms my suspicion. ;)<br>
<br>
I'd say hooah--but I'm not sure if the USMC uses that term, as <br>
well?  As for trail names, what about 'never quit' or something to <br>
do with a unit motto/mascot?  To be honest, that's how my sister A-<br>
Bear (from Idaho) got her trailname.  Years ago, her squad mascot <br>
was grizzly bears.  She's been a big fan of bears ever since.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps, we'll see a few of you on some trails in CA in a few days? <br>
As it's taken me almost a half day just to consolidate clues for <br>
just a handful of regions of CA--boy, the boxing scene down there <br>
has changed rather exponentially since our last trip through the <br>
Golden State.  Back then, we could have printed the clues to every <br>
box in the state in about 40 pages--now I'm pushing over 200 pages <br>
and that's only 2 'regions' from the LBNA map of CA.  I haven't <br>
gotten anywhere close to touching the Bay Area yet!  I think Kinko's <br>
will be printing these clues for me this time around as my printer's <br>
fritzed!<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

I just responded to this but yahoo timed out and I lost the message--<br>
I apologize if this appears twice, if the first response indeed made <br>
it through.<br>
<br>
It's sort of nebulous!  We're going to be somewhere between Tacoma, <br>
Washington and Coronado NAS during the 2+ week long trip.  Our dates <br>
at Coronado are fairly tight for the week we'll be there (that may <br>
be the easiest time to link up with us) but everything else is just <br>
sort of where we end up on that particular day.  I think we'll be on <br>
I-5/other interstates/highways on the trip down there but want to <br>
explore as many spots along 1/101 on our return leg--hoping to spend <br>
some time in Marin County (where I used to live 'pre-internet' era) <br>
and continue up the coast until at least Eureka when we'll cut back <br>
over to I-5.  We'll be either camping/cheap hoteling/youth hosteling <br>
it most of the way.  <br>
<br>
We're always up for exchanges!  We've had the great fortune to have <br>
already linked up with Princess Lea, Sleepy Cat, Spacy Holly and her <br>
children at previous times.  Some folks have also met my sister, A-<br>
Bear from Idaho, at the 1st Bay Area Gathering a couple of years ago-<br>
-or have found a few of her CA letterboxes she planted along her <br>
travels.  As for linking up with us, we'll have sporadic internet <br>
access (dependent upon wifi hot spots) and a cell phone on us.  Just <br>
contact us offline if you want to coordinate something.<br>
