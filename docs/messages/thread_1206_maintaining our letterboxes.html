couple of hours after Princess Lea evidently) and turned up empty-<br/>
handed! Hasn't happened in a LONG time and we were bummed! Good news is <br/>
this is my old stomping grounds and I went a few miles down the road to <br/>
Rheem Valley where my dad had a store when I was a kid. In the whole, <br/>
huge shopping center, only 3 of the stores remained as they were in <br/>
1965: the Rheem Theater, the barber shop and Loard's Ice Cream <br/>
parlor!!! I paid 17 cents for a single cone back then. Of course, I had <br/>
to have one today--ice cream for dinner!!--and even at $2.50 it still <br/>
made our 'boxing failure a little sweeter.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we'll get back there soon to find this one. <br/>
