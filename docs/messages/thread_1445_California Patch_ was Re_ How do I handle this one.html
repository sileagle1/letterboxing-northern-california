&gt; On a totally different note, I am hoping that our artists in <br/>
residence, Lisa and Kel (aT) are <br/>
&gt; thinking about designs for the patch - I'd really like to see what <br/>
you ladies come up with!  <br/>
&gt; We had previously discussed a Northern California logo (redwoods? <br/>
gold? grizzlies?), and <br/>
&gt; the new proposal on the table is a patch for all of California - do <br/>
we have a preference?<br/>
