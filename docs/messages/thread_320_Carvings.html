I am not sure what this intails, but as long as it is not a weeknight <br/>
I am game to give it a shot.  I can always use the help on carving?  <br/>
Is it for people who are placing a stamp and box or just people who <br/>
are using their stamp now when they LB or both? Is thier someone who <br/>
does the demonstrating?  Sounds like fun.  Depending on when it is I <br/>
say we go for it.  I would offer my place but I live in a 1 bedroom <br/>
and have noooooooo room at all. Sorry wish I did.  M<br/>
