I want to hear more about favorite boxes, stamps, hikes and places. <br>
Don't stop now, you were on a roll for a while and I found it quite<br>
interesting.<br>
<br>
Now, as far as Princess Lea's offer of a stamp carving demo:  I, for<br>
one, would be interested in the carving demo, but I may be a minority,<br>
since everyone else does such a fabulous job, already.  So, Princess,<br>
it may be just you and me. Smile.  Even if you aren't interested in<br>
the demo or just simple don't need expert advice, you meaning those of<br>
you that has the techniques down, could still show up and visit. How<br>
about it? <br>
<br>
We had a pretty successful letterboxing day, yesterday in Sonoma<br>
County.  It was an absolutely beautiful fall day!!  Sunny, and with<br>
just enough wind to make the leaves fall and keep us cool.<br>
<br>
We picked up the 4 stamps in Healdsburg, plus the Big Bamboo Hitch<br>
Hiker.  We also got the Holy Canoli Batman and spent some time talking<br>
to people on the street about the sculptures.  Even got to meet the<br>
man that does them.  Very interesting!! He will make one for anyone on<br>
the block that is interested in having one in their yards, for free. <br>
It is his choice, as to what he makes.  He considers this block his<br>
advertisement.  If you or I were interested in one, it would be for a<br>
price, of course.  We ended our day by picking up Lachryma Montis in<br>
Sonoma for a total of 6 boxes and 1 hitch hiker and a great day! <br>
Thanks to all of you clever people.<br>

Was the Lachryma Montis stamp there?  We were there a few weeks ago and the stamp was missing, but the logbook was there so we stamped in....just wondering?  Sounds like a great day of boxing!  We've been too busy this weekend to get out there...but with the beautiful weather...it has been pulling at the strings of my hiking boots!  <br>
 <br>
Our favorite find so far was the Natomas Oaks box...on our first try!  We loved the clues.  And the very micro-ness of the box!  We are working on the Lemony Snicket clues as well....sounds like we aren't alone.  Our first box was The Lion King - a very fun first find....with a great stamp.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well here is the Don & Gwen favorite place. Our very first plant and one of the crappiest stamps is at our Anniversary/Western Divide letterbox located just off the Western Divide Hwy between Springville and Kernville. We planted the letterbox on our anniversary, and the box is located in a grotto behind the waterfall. This place is certainly magical as this is also where our son-in-law proposed to our daughter on their search for the letterbox. The trail, waterfall has no signage so most folks do not know about the location. It is very rare when you might spot someone in the area. When Silent Doug cruised into Kernville he told me it is in his top ten. <br>
<br>
Re: The crappiest stamps always seem to be at the best locations since these special locations are the first you want to share.<br>
