<br>
I am a teacher and babysitter who went on my first letterboxing adventure last weekend. It was great fun - the kids (4 and 8) had a blast and we plan to go out again soon (although it's supposed to snow for the next weeks so it'll probably be longer than we think!). Also, there are only two other boxes in our area so we may have to drive fairly far to find more.<br>

Welcome to the hobby.  I haven't been at it terribly long either so I<br>
still remember the excitement of finding your first letterbox.<br>
Congratulations to you.<br>
<br>
Where do you live?<br>

I'm at South LAke Tahoe, and I think I can safely say that,<br>
at the moment, all the boxes I've planted here are inaccessible.<br>
Wheee! do we have snow!<br>
