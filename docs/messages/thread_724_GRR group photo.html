  I want to thank everyone for the wonderful time we had at the Romp. <br/>
I am so glad we drove down for it.<br/>
  Also, I'd be happy to mail anyone a copy of the group photo that I <br/>
got. Unfortunately Sierra Sally isn't in this photo (thanks Sally for <br/>
taking it!), as well as many others who were probably having lunch. <br/>
You can see the picture on the yahoo group site under photos in the <br/>
GRR folder, and its called: A group photo.  When the picture is <br/>
printed out, you can see the faces a bit better.<br/>
  If you would like me to mail you a copy of this picture, email me <br/>
offline with your address. <br/>
Thanks again!!<br/>
