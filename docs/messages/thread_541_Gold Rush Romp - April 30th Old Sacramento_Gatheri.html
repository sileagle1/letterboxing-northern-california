  Oh, wow! I had no idea and didn't get to thinking about that yet. I'm<br>
  surprised - I'd think anything like that could be construed as a potential<br>
  bomb.... (I'm not kidding! I grew up there, and we were taught early on to<br>
  pay attention to any unattended objects.)<br>
<br>
  Thanks for the tip. We'll check it out if we're anywhere near there.<br>
