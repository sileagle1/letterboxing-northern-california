                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got back from an afternoon of determining hiding spots for my <br/>
next two boxes. Took a friend with me for assistance with developing <br/>
clues and to serve as a "reality check". Since we covered two vast  <br/>
separate areas, we're exhausted from lots of walking and exploring.<br/>
<br/>
The very next box is called "Nepenthe", which refers to the potion <br/>
mentioned in ancient Greek mythology. Nepenthe induces forgetfulness <br/>
of sorrows, troubles, and grief, as does visiting the location where <br/>
this letterbox will rest. My friend had never been to this spot <br/>
before, and agreed that it did clear his head and had its own <br/>
special beauty &amp; uniqueness. To get there, you're going to have to <br/>
invoke the assistance of the Greek gods, and avoid Medusa, the <br/>
harpies, and the Cyclops. Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, yes, there is a restaurant in Big Sur by the same name).<br/>
<br/>
While at my Nepenthe, I promoted the notion of letterboxing to 4 <br/>
enthusiastically interested folks who are new to SF. I'm hoping to <br/>
eventually see an increasing number of new boxes, so that Princess <br/>
Lea doesn't get bored.<br/>
<br/>
Vertigo Letterbox #2 is also almost ready to go to its home. Box #1 <br/>
is just tricky enough to screen out the riff-raff, and you can't get <br/>
to #2 (or later, #3) without solving #1. Therefore, boxes #2 and #3 <br/>
are for the more 'elite' hunters. Why be riff-raff, anyway?<br/>
<br/>
After I get those settled, it'll be time to visit some bison and Mt. <br/>
Sutro! Whew! Letterboxing is hard work! <br/>
