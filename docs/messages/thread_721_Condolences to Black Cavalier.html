so sad when a box goes missing when you have put alo tof thought and <br>
energy into it.  <br>
<br>
I just got an email from a state park ranger that one of my boxes was <br>
found on the trail and has been removed from the park....hmmm, <br>
hopefully it was vandals. It was 1 of a possible 3 at Jack London SP, <br>
not sure which one yet.  AT least I was not told to cease and desist <br>
my planting...or perhpas it was implied in that they made no offer of <br>
returning the box to me.  <br>
