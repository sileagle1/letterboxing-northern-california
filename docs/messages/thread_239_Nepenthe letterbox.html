On 6/26/2004 some geocachers had the cajones to put their cache right next to our letterbox. Since we have had bad experiences with geocachers in the past we decided to let them have the spot and find another location. We then posted a fairly tactful message on their cache/log page to reflect the intrusion. I am not suggesting that you do the same, but I made sure that the geocachers had several caches in the area. Hopefully they will take my note properly and not start vandalizing letterboxes. <br/>

who <br/>
&gt;   pillaged Nepenthe. They were going to send a flock of harpies to <br/>
&gt;   tear their hearts out, but I stopped them (Hera's idea, you <br/>
know), <br/>
&gt;   that's a bit extreme.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; I just e-mailed the person who placed the geocache to see if <br/>
we <br/>
&gt;   can have both boxes co-exist peacefully...  The geocache itself <br/>
was <br/>
&gt;   full of the same garbage that was attracting flies... nothing <br/>
I'd <br/>
&gt;   exchange anything but a used Kleenex for.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Nepenthe is a very popular and well-liked letterbox, and so, I <br/>
&gt;   feel that it deserves replacing... AGAIN!! I hope the geocacher <br/>
&amp; I <br/>
&gt;   can make some sort of arrangement.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; In the meantime, Aphrodite sends her blessings to you, and <br/>
Hermes <br/>
&gt;   will let you know when NEPENTHE RISES AGAIN!!<br/>

&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   Is there any further information on this letterbox? I saw <br/>
that <br/>
&gt;   it was replaced at <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   the end of July....I went to the location last night, but <br/>
all I <br/>
&gt;   found was that silly <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   geocache. (apologies in advance to any geocachers) (btw - i <br/>
have <br/>
&gt;   some <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   marvelous ideas regarding creating fake geocache boxes).  I <br/>
&gt;   searched (fairly <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   thoroughly) all crevices at foot level, but there was some <br/>
&gt;   unpleasant garbage <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   attracting flies and I didn't have gloves or a stick. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;   thanks!<br/>

That stamp is awesome.  My letterboxing pals are Scott  S. and <br/>

Nepenthe..and <br/>
we were worried that we had a curse or something.  We did find<br/>
Star-Crossed <br/>
a couple of weeks ago and it was oh-so worth it.  I want to thank you<br/>

I'm working on a special chemical solution that makes letterboxes invisible until a  letterboxer approaches. It'll sense the presence of their personal stamp, and only then will it become visible (Ha! Ha! Raspberries to geocachers!)<br/>
<br/>
Gee, if people want my boxes so badly that they want to take them, maybe I should start selling them on Market Street ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed Star-Crossed, and yes, I have another box with a very big hinged stamp that's almost finished. <br/>
