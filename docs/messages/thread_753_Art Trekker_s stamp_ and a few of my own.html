<br/>
I remember the first time I saw this stamp. Just beautiful. Kel had<br/>
also noted that the box was in a lot of poison oak, so I spent the<br/>
rest of the hike muttering "don't touch your face....don't touch your<br/>
face." I'm still in East Coast mode, and forget to look for poison oak.<br/>
<br/>
I've been planting and carving stamps like a mad fool. Too bad for you<br/>
guys (except maybe Paul) that they're in upstate NY, where two days<br/>
ago we ahd tornado warnings, and all hunkered into the trap room<br/>
(basement) of the opera house.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, my sweetie Robb just planted his first box. Right now it is<br/>
just listed on LBNA.  It is called Cormorant something or other.<br/>

Take Care y'all!<br/>
