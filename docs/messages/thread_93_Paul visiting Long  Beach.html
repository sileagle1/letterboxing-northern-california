                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome friend....we sure do need more LONG BEACH VISITORS.   We lived in Long Beach when we started boxing so have plenty of stamps for you there, some harder than others to find.  For a tough series, go for Stamp golf but do your measures equivilent  homework firist and get a 6 foot or longer length or rope or cord to help you measure yardage once the clues are solved.    Then try Cal State Long Beach, 2 easy ones and one harder one (but definately doable if you read up and research just a bit ahead of time).<br/>
Our El Dorado series may be iffy, but if you have time try for them.  We usually lose a box or 2 around Easter with all the folks hunting for eggs in the park.  One of our favorite boxes is White by Day near the aquarium (Perfect for a nite time hunt).  Also an easy night time box is a drive by on Signal Hill.  There are several other boxes of ours plus a couple of other boxes by other placers in the area too.<br/>
One of our early boxes is accessible by canoe or Kayak (rentals available at Alamitos Bay) Heron and Tinman, then if you wanted to hit I'm a Heron too via boat, you are close by.<br/>
<br/>
We have a cool (I must say) series in Seal Beach, just into Orange County that is a real fun adventure .  Hope you have a great time boxing and plant them and you will have visitors.   Let us know how you did .   As for urban planting, think small.such as 35 mm film canisters or <br/>
altoid tins with tiny journals and stamps then glue on strong magnets and  place  them under metal park benches, under newspaper racks, along drain pipes.  With homeless folks about try and avoid most parks and other gathering places.  Remember, stealth and discrete actions when placing or finding.   Have fun, Gwen<br/>

&gt; Welcome friend....we sure do need more LONG BEACH VISITORS.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info! I'm looking forward a long weekend outside of <br/>
the fog zone. I've already printed out the Long Beach clues, and <br/>
reviewed them - they sound like fun.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be visiting a traveling companion of mine, Rita, who lives on <br/>
Park Ave. We travel well together, as we both like to explore the <br/>
places most tourists ignore. I'm going to share my introduction with <br/>
letterboxing with her, and as she sells real estate, she'll know her <br/>
way around. It'll be a fun way to spend some of the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
As 2 newbies hunting, it'll either be a brilliant experience, or a <br/>
comedy of errors. If she really gets into it, we'll keep going for <br/>
more, and who knows, we may even try to plant one... I have the <br/>
kernal of an idea for a LB box already.<br/>
<br/>
I spent a good portion of the afternoon working on my first SF box. <br/>
Went to my site, found a good spot to plant, then worked backwards <br/>
to make a collection of clues that works like a maze at that <br/>
location. To figure out where the basic site is, you have to solve <br/>
22 word questions on a theme to form a phrase. The phrase, in turn, <br/>
is an anagram for the location site. I give you the correct order of <br/>
the letters in the location, all you have to do is transpose the <br/>
letters using my numbered blanks. At the site, I direct you to a <br/>
mini-box which starts you on the maze and leads you to the box.<br/>
<br/>
I had a buddy with me, and made him test my maze directions, and he <br/>
made it all the way to the second box, the goal. (He made an <br/>
appropriate small number of mistakes that he was able to correct on <br/>
his own).<br/>
<br/>
I discovered that by having a length of wire firmly attached to the <br/>
mini-box that it vastly increased potential hiding spots. The wire <br/>
allowed me to easily attach within reach, but out of sight.<br/>
<br/>
Almost ready to launch box #1 with its mini-box -- I just want to <br/>
add a few educational/cultural details and postcards and then re-<br/>
check everything.<br/>
<br/>
Looking foward to LB sleuthing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like you have gotten to the core of what letterboxing can be:   Massive time spent creating a gift for others to get crazy about!   Wish I could seek your S.F. box.  I love the wire idea.  We have used string similarly but wire would blend in better , last longer and extend hiding options.    . <br/>
 I think you will do fine on Stamp golf and Seal Beach town tour.   Go gettum.  Rita will know of Joe Jost's try it for lunch;it is part of old Long Beach history. As a  pre driver's license kid. I spent hours during the summer walking <br/>
 on Park Ave. from   Park Estates to the  "Shore" to spend summer hours at the Bay with friends.<br/>
The weekend of 24th  there will be a letterbox <br/>
gathering in Kernville (where we live now) giving us a chance to meet several of the Southern Calif. boxers and a few folks from further away.  <br/>
<br/>
 Buzzard is right; there are many great boxes in Pasadena too; we are still working on getting to some of them.<br/>
Enjoy your visit!  Gwen<br/>
