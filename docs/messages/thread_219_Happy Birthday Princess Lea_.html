If memory serves, it is the anniversary of the birth of our intrepid west coast 'boxer, Princess Lea. We see by her post that she's been 'boxing in the southern part of the state, a perfectly splendid way to spend a special day.<br/>
<br/>
Many, many more!<br/>

I've had a couple of days to settle down from my quickie trip to the San Luis Obispo area, <br/>
and here's my report of finds and attempts for future reference:<br/>
<br/>
FINDS (boxes Alive &amp; Well)<br/>
Little Bastard<br/>
Dead Man's Party<br/>
Moonstone Castle<br/>
Homestead Big Sur (2)<br/>
The Lorax<br/>
Canyon Owl<br/>
Way Cool<br/>
Jade Cove<br/>
Arrrgh! Pirate's Cove<br/>
Mission San Luis Obispo<br/>
Stamp Luis Obispo<br/>
Camelot #2 and #5<br/>
Los Osos Oaks #1<br/>
Send Me An Angel<br/>
Eucalyptus Grove<br/>
Stairway to Heaven<br/>
Mission Nuestra Senora de la Soledad<br/>
<br/>
ATTEMPTS<br/>
Astonishing Creatures: Sea Anemones (I was SUPER bummer this one was missing)<br/>
Big Sur Marathon<br/>
Can O Spam<br/>
Nature Box<br/>
Camelot #3 and #4 (3 appears to missing, 4 is probably still there but I was suffering from <br/>
heat-addled brain and couldn't figure out which tree I was supposed to search)<br/>
Elephant Seals (thanks to Sierra Sally for the short notice clue - unfortuantely it looks like <br/>
the volunteers clean up there quite often and the box was gone - found a suspicious rock <br/>
that should have been guarding it; did see some real elephant seals though, as well as the <br/>
zebras at Hearst Castle!)<br/>
<br/>
I also planted 2 boxes along the way while I was down there.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I was greatly hampered by LbNA being down during the time I was visiting - <br/>
the majority of the SLO boxes are LbNA only and I didn't have printed copies. I am <br/>
particularly annoyed at missing the Big Sur Vista box for lack of information - I was RIGHT <br/>
THERE.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don't think Stamp Luis Obispo was meant to be a word of mouth only clue, but the <br/>
box is not listed anywhere, not LbNA or AQ. I think it is safe to mention here on our list: it <br/>
is at the stamp store in SLO, on Chorro St. It was sitting on top of the cash register, <br/>
patiently awaiting visitors - I was the first to stamp in since 2004! I meant to get in <br/>
earlier, but seems like every time I am SLO, it is Sunday when the shop is not open. <br/>
