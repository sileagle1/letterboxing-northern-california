Rumor has it that Lemony Snicket has been hiding some really neat <br/>
boxes that are definitely worth the effort of tracking down.  <br/>
There's one in Florida that one person told me has the "best" <br/>
logbook he's ever seen, and he has over 800 boxes to his count, <br/>
which makes it sound impressive indeed.  (He didn't think to get <br/>
pictures of the book, though, so it's still a mystery.)<br/>
<br/>
Any in case, there is a Snicket box near Aurburn--a bit off I-5--<br/>
that might be worth nabbing.<br/>

There is a small park/picnic area, rest rooms, outstanding Elk, and of course a letterbox, that will not take you very long to locate. If you are starting out above Willows, Ca. then our "Wild Goose" would be a good driveby.Sierra Sally has "California Outlaws-Juaquin Murrieta" that looks like it would be very close to 5.<br/>

On our last trip to SLO we found that several of Sir B's and Juggler Mouse's letterboxes have gone missing or at least we could not find them. I'm not sure that they are being maintained ? Pandora's letterbox near the girl and bear was still in place, and that seemed surprising .<br/>

Funny you should mention that box, since I checked up on this just <br/>
this afternoon.  I really didn't think it would still be around, but <br/>
dang, it still is.  That's a box that just keeps on ticking....  <br/>
(Even if it is soaked through and the logbook is full.  Must do some <br/>
maintenance the next time I'm downtown.)<br/>
<br/>
All of my boxes are okay as far as I know, except for the Run For <br/>
the Border box which I have to find a new hiding place for.  (The <br/>
old hiding place was bulldozed over and is now an outdoor patio for <br/>
a restaurant.)  This weekend I was planning to hike up to the Islay <br/>
Hill box to replace the logbook which I've heard is soaked through.  <br/>
Oh, and the Sweet Springs Box--which doesn't have an online clue--I <br/>
pulled because the container cracked and the logbook was soaked <br/>
through.  I intend to replant it, though.<br/>
<br/>
And Wendy Gault was the last person to sign in!  *gasp!*  Can't <br/>
believe she came out to the area and didn't even bother to look me <br/>
up.  *sniffle*<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Sir B or Juggler Mouse have actually pulled any of <br/>
their boxes, but I don't think they're maintaining them either and I <br/>
know of a number that are missing.<br/>
<br/>
So....  I think that about covers all I know about the San Luis area <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>

JugglerMouse and/or Sir B to check, or you could just stop by at Leon's  <br/>
Bookstore when you're in SLO and see if JMouse is working (her "real"  <br/>
name is Susie).  As far as my boxes down there, I have had a report  <br/>
that Stinky Cheese is missing, but Ocean-O was still alive and well  <br/>
about a month ago.  By the way, I had a lot of trouble with the Camelot  <br/>
series.  I finally figured out where to start and got #1, but didn't  <br/>
find 2, 3 or 4 before my daughter saw a snake and demanded that we  <br/>
return to the car.  I had not made it far enough to look for #5.  I had  <br/>
to listen to her ranting about how much she hated Ryan all the way down  <br/>
the hill.<br/>

Lemony Snicket has become my letterboxing hero :-)<br/>
<br/>
We found The Wide Window box today - the logbook and stamp were both <br/>
exquisite. Well worth the dusty tromp. I was almost apprehensive to <br/>
put my substandard handwriting to the pages! Second finders. Did take <br/>
pictures, but not sure we want to post them on our site and <br/>
potentially ruin the fun surprise for other finders - newbie enough <br/>
not to know if there's a standard of etiquette as far as that goes...?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Rumor has it that Lemony Snicket has been hiding some really neat <br/>
&gt; boxes that are definitely worth the effort of tracking down.  <br/>
&gt; There's one in Florida that one person told me has the "best" <br/>
&gt; logbook he's ever seen, and he has over 800 boxes to his count, <br/>
&gt; which makes it sound impressive indeed.  (He didn't think to get <br/>
&gt; pictures of the book, though, so it's still a mystery.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any in case, there is a Snicket box near Aurburn--a bit off I-5--<br/>
&gt; that might be worth nabbing.<br/>

&gt; I've been told to stay away from the murderers, though.  Whatever <br/>
&gt; that means.  *shrug*  =)<br/>
