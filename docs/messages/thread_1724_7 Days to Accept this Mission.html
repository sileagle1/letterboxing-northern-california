<br>
On Tuesday, February 9, I will post this under the event section of Atlas Quest at 7 pm (PST)! From the moment this event is posted, we will start accepting team sign ups. This is a teams only event. This game is designed for twelve teams. And no more.<br>
<br>
When you sign up, you must AQ mail me your team name, team leader and names of the rest of your team members.* I will list your teams on this event listing and it will serve as a count off.<br>
<br>
You have 7 days secret agents . . . .<br>
