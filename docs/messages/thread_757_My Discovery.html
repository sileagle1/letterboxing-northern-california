I think the Drew Clan's P count may exceed all other letterboxers. Jay <br>
is a gifted carver and has the majority of his letterboxes planted in <br>
the northeast, so this makes his Wharf Cat even more special.I hate <br>
that many stairs, but the stamp was worth it.<br>

Aw, shucks! *scuffles feet* Coming from Don, that means alot. And it's <br>
also true what he says about things not always being what they seem on <br>
these letterboxing lists...some links, flames, and oddball posts <br>
deserve a close second look. <br>

Shhh....  That's for people to find on their own. ;o)  Secret links<br>
abound everywhere. Actually, that's the only one on this talk list so<br>
far as I know, but some people like to be sneaky like that. =)<br>
