Rubbermaid had the right to run their business as they<br/>
please. People who work there can choose not to work<br/>
there anymore. Consumers have the right to buy or not<br/>
to buy. <br/>
<br/>
If I boycotted every company who had policies with<br/>
whom I did not agree- my list would be a mile long and<br/>
it would be difficult to get much done. Instead, I<br/>
worry about governments which discriminate against<br/>
people with impunity, politicians who feel they are<br/>
accountable to no one, and lawyers who sue for fun and<br/>
profit.  Those are the real enemies.<br/>

I agree....  I really have tooooo much to think about other than <br/>
which kind of piece of plastic made by which company in which country <br/>
to buy.  Boycotting only means that they sell less, make less money <br/>
and can't afford as many employees and then the small person who <br/>
really needs a job doesn't have one.  That million $$ VP ain't gonna <br/>
get canned.<br/>
<br/>
I've been experimenting with recycling containers and think the empty <br/>
plastic peanut butter jars are an excellent candidate.<br/>

I don't think that in this day and age, you can separate <br/>
corporations from government. That's why you have energy policies <br/>
crafted behind closed doors, fake research institutes publishing <br/>
questionable info that are funded by corporate interests, lobbyists <br/>
running amuck... and more. I believe in corporate ethics and <br/>
responsibility, and the public should be a watchdog. Maybe if we cut <br/>
tax write-offs to companies sending jobs offshore, we wouldn't have <br/>
people scrounging for minimum wage jobs at Walmart or McDee's.<br/>
Personally, in the past, I HAVE had to worry about keeping my job <br/>
because of who I am, and what I do in private. I can't simply brush <br/>
it off and walk away.<br/>
<br/>
I hope for a better world, and try to do what I can to improve it. <br/>
Tomorrow, Christmas, you'll find me at an AIDS hospice that serves <br/>
the destitute -- these days, mostly people of color and women.<br/>
<br/>
On that note, I hope all of you have a wonderful holiday, and a <br/>
promising New Year!<br/>
