Princess Lea) got together with Turtle McQ and did an little <br/>
letterboxing in the SFO Bay area. Princess Lea was able to get some <br/>
letterbox maintenance done on her Amazon Survivor Series and Turtle <br/>
McQ and I were able to add to our F counts. <br/>
<br/>
Of course a Hitchhiker was found, the Maryland SkipJack, and it was <br/>
last seen sailing around Puget Sound!<br/>
