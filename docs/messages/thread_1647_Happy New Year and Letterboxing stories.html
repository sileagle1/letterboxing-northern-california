Just got an amazing story about one of my letterboxes. Had to share <br/>
it. My box is called Blast off and it's a cartoon rocket stamp near <br/>
Kennedy Space Center's Astronaut Hall of Fame.  Here's the message:<br/>
Message: <br/>
Hi there,  Just wanted to let you know that we found your box on <br/>
December 20, 2007.  And... WHILE I WAS STAMPING, my husband <br/>
says, "Joanne, look up!" and there, up in the sky, was a rocket!  How <br/>
cool is that!  Thanks for the memory!<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of the time I found a hitchhiker called "Julie's 40" <br/>
celebrating her 40th's birthday. I found it on my 40th birthday! <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure some of you have similar stories...please share<br/>
