Hi to all.  Today Jeff and I set out to do some LBing.  We started <br/>
with a Hybrid.  Letter to Garcia in Peteluma because we were on the <br/>
way to Healdsburg for Healdsburg Quartet.  Well we DNF Garcia. A dead <br/>
bird in the grass that made us leave though.  WE did however find all <br/>
4 of the Quartet.  From there we went to do a few Geocaches.  1 was <br/>
about 3 miles on Healdsburg Ave.  That one was destroyed by someone <br/>
or something.  WE found items all over. :(.  Then we went on to do <br/>
another Cache in Windsor.  Found that one. So we found 5 out of 7.  <br/>
Not bad for a days work.  Since we only have a total of 9 Letterboxes <br/>
found we can honestly say that todays #1 Quartet is our favorite one <br/>
so far.   WE had lunch after we found it in this cute little deli and <br/>
the memorabilia was just wonderful.  Brings back memories of my <br/>
younger days... LOL.All in all we had a good day.  A little sore from <br/>
using the muscles we don't use all week but we had a good time. Still <br/>
wating for Vertigo 1 to resurface so we can do 1 and 2.  Who knows <br/>
and maybe #3??????????<br/>

IT must of been a weekend for LB/Geocache hybrids in Sonoma County!  <br/>
Chicken Man and I with Ben found the Lunar New Year Hybrid and <br/>
alhtough we did not find box 2, box #1 was a treasure....a beautiful <br/>
handmade book, not a handmade stamp, but the whole experince was <br/>
great.  YOu can access it via the geochache site. And I was casing the <br/>
place for a good hiding place for a letterbox.  Another reason to come <br/>
visit Sonoma COunty.  <br/>

PS, I have several more boxes planned for the nearby areas as well.<br/>
PSS&gt;  I think I have only had 2 visitors to Twine COuntry....So as <br/>
added incentive I have 2 free passes for the Shultz Museum.  Email me <br/>
if you are interested in them and I can mail them to you. <br/>

For those of you who like STEEP but short hikes checkout Wascally's <br/>
Dragonfly and You and I boxes (great vies too) also while in Novato, <br/>
not so steep but definitely uphill grades: Miwok Trails by <br/>
Letterboxing Fools. BE forewarned some poison oak very close to box 1. <br/>
<br/>
That is all I did  this weekend.  <br/>
<br/>

PS Lea...let me know if you are coming thru SAnta Rosa and if you plan <br/>
to visit Twine Country box 1...I have a special prize for you.  <br/>
