I am sending condolences for all your mishaps.  YOu certainly deserve <br>
an A+ for perserverance!  Perhaps I am tempting fate to even read the <br>
clues for the LEmoy Snicket since I am off to a bad start.  What is <br>
the title for this box?  I searched using Lemony Snicket and got no <br>
hits.  I did a check of box names for NOrthern CA, CEntral CA and <br>
Sierras but none of the titles seemd to be the right one.  (I admit I <br>
did not want to read each set of clues, but only scanned the names).<br>

You can find the clue under 'Links' on the left-hand side of the <br>
screen.  (This is assuming your using the web interface and not <br>
receiving posts via e-mail.)  Look under 'Clues! Clues! Clues!'.<br>
