<br/>
Princess Lea suggested I post the announcement for this gathering <br/>
here too to make sure everyone hears about it.<br/>
<br/>
We have a listing on Atlas Quest for this gathering, but am happy to <br/>
send info directly to anyone interested.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, we're putting together something in Alum Rock Park, San <br/>
Jose, CA for April Fool's Day.  We'll rent one or more group picnic <br/>
areas, bring food, and try to recruit someone to give lessons on <br/>
stamp carving or other interesting topics.  If folks are bringing <br/>
small kids, we are happy to plan some activities specific for the <br/>
little ones (our kids are teenagers, but we remember what it is like <br/>
to have little ones).<br/>
<br/>
Any requests, please contact me.  Also, please please please RSVP.  <br/>
Parking is decent at Alum Rock, as the date approaches there will be <br/>
some messages going out on the logistics to make sure everyone has a <br/>
hassle-free time.  Plus, we want to have enough grub for everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
