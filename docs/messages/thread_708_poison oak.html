When I did Who Goes There at the beginning of April, there was <br/>
juicy poison oak EVERYWHERE. Two of the boxes were literally <br/>
buried in it. I would prefer the world to see my pink tushie than to <br/>
contract poison oak on same.<br/>

Ah, yes, the poison oak part of the day was sort of overshadowed <br/>
in my memory by the "nature watching."  I think you may have <br/>
written something about poison oak on the log book, which <br/>
prompted me to look around and realize that I'm still looking at <br/>
ground cover with East Coast eyes.  I look for poison ivy, not oak.  <br/>
I spent the rest of the trip telling myself  "don't touch your <br/>
face....don't touch your face...."  And that evening I went to a party <br/>
where the host's neck was an angry red blob of poison oak.  I <br/>
consider myself very fortunate to have missed that experience!<br/>
