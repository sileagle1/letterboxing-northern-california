<br/>
I've posted the group photo I took at the wonderfully fun gathering <br/>
yesterday. We don't know why but this gathering was just perfect! <br/>
Was it the great letterboxes, the free, lack-of-structure feel it <br/>
had or the great combination of letterboxers themselves that made it <br/>
so special? Even the fact that we had a group of 24 hanging around <br/>
at the end of the day to grab this great photo was special! Old Blue <br/>
and I just had a ball! Take a look at the group shot and see if I <br/>
got the names of everyone correct (not my strong suit!)<br/>

It was great to meet everyone and we're looking forward to getting back <br/>

missed.<br/>
