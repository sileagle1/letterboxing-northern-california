<br>
I've posted the group photo I took at the wonderfully fun gathering <br>
yesterday. We don't know why but this gathering was just perfect! <br>
Was it the great letterboxes, the free, lack-of-structure feel it <br>
had or the great combination of letterboxers themselves that made it <br>
so special? Even the fact that we had a group of 24 hanging around <br>
at the end of the day to grab this great photo was special! Old Blue <br>
and I just had a ball! Take a look at the group shot and see if I <br>
got the names of everyone correct (not my strong suit!)<br>
<br>
Back row from left: Doublesaj & Old Blue, RedSF, Boo's Clues, Celtic <br>

Front row: SFMomo, Tako Bunny, 3Vix, Spygirl, Heather, Baby <br>

<br>
A few folks had to leave early including Grumpy Grinch and Red Hat <br>
Queen (AK HSM's mom!)<br>
<br>
Thanks to AK HomeSchool Mommy for getting us all together, making <br>
for a very fun event indeed!<br>

It was great to meet everyone and we're looking forward to getting back <br>

missed.<br>
