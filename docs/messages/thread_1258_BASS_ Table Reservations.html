<br/>
I called EB Parks today and here's the scoop on reservations:<br/>
<br/>
The only lot left was Lot "C" (I think that's what she said).  It has<br/>
tables and DOES have a BBQ pit and seats about 35, which should be plenty<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
The woman I spoke to suggested that we go visit it this week and make sure<br/>
it would do.  We have the spot on temporary hold for a week until next<br/>
Monday, at which time I need to call back and claim it.<br/>
<br/>
If I claim it, I'll need to pony up $72, which I can do.  Also, someone<br/>
will have to be at the spot by 10:30am on the day of the event to<br/>
physically stake it, according to EB Parks.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd give someone a chance to go check out the spot and let us<br/>
know if it's good - though I suspect we'll take it regardless.  I'm<br/>
leaving tomorrow but return on Saturday, and will be around on Monday to<br/>
make the final claim on the site.<br/>
<br/>
Sound good?<br/>
