                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just an update.  Of course, it looks like our bathroom remodel which <br/>
was supposed to be finished the end of June will not be quite finished <br/>
by the day of the gabbering.  Which means only one working bathroom in <br/>
the house.....but there is a very nice, well maintained, practically <br/>
brand new port-a-potty in our driveway to handle the, umm, overflow.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if that villianous COunt Olaf had anything to do with the <br/>
fact we got all the wrong windows delivered? (which is why we are <br/>
behind schedule)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if folks can overlook our stuffed garage and home office- <br/>
turned-bedroom things can proceed well I believe.  <br/>
<br/>
Gotta carve my stamp...hmmm maybe that prota potty would make a good <br/>
hiding place.......<br/>

Why not carve a Porta-Potty stamp?<br/>

<br/>
I look foward to meeting everyone on Sunday. I have a question on a HH.<br/>
I have a LB placed in Petaluma and a finder asked about a HH that was <br/>
in it. So I went by and picked it up (I will drop to 1 person at the <br/>
event). The question is, I tried to find info about it and can not find <br/>
anything on Alta Quest or Letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
The bag has HATBOX H'Hiker, the log book has letterboxing.org #57 <br/>
12/14/02 it is called "culpepper" and has a cool stamp.<br/>

invade your home for the day.  All the food was wonderful.  I came away <br/>
with a baggie of Caroles Pasta salad.  Yummy.... I vote YES that we all <br/>
send our recipes to Mary.   If not everyone  doesn't want to do that I <br/>
am more than happy to send anyone the Spinach Dip recipe.&lt;----- Laura)<br/>
It was wonderful to meet new Lbers and wonderful getting to see <br/>
everyone we have already had the pleasure of meeting before.  Great <br/>
getting different tips and advice and ideas from everyone.  <br/>
Also a big Thank You to Laura and her gang for letting Jeff and I <br/>
"tag along".<br/>
MoonRabbit is was a joy talking to you and I want you to know I held <br/>
that lovely box every which way and made Jeff take pictures from every <br/>
side.  LOL  <br/>
I sure can't wait for the next gathering/gabbering.  Tahoe anyone????WE <br/>
could rent a Hotel and spend the weekend boxing and gathering??? Thanks <br/>
again everyone.  WE are glad to of made some really wonderful friends. <br/>
