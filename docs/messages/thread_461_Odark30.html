This morning was Crisp and clear (not to mention dark)so on the way to work <br>
I stopped by and found the Furry-O box. Have to take advantage of no rain!<br>
Was able to pull up and park and using my headlights had no problem finding <br>
the box in the dark<br>
Stamped in and was on my way. Wasn't even late to work!s<br>
<br>
I work in Sacramento, (21st and Q) not very far from Old town, Can't wait <br>
for the get together!<br>
