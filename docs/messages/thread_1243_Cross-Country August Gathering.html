Either each gathering would make 2 copies of the event stamp &amp; send one<br/>
across country beforehand, so the boxers can get both stamps at both<br/>
gatherings.  Or, a special "hello from fellow boxers on the other side<br/>
of the country" type stamp.<br/>

one we like and if it's the same as the other, even better!<br/>
