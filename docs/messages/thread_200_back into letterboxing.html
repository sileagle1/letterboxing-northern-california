                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!<br>
allow me to introduce myself.<br>
My name's Matt Sparks, known online as MaltedFalcon.<br>
Was into Letterboxing in 1999 and 2000, then got into geocaching and <br>
my home business- kind of lost track of letterboxing. at the time <br>
there wasn't a whole lot of local letterboxes.<br>
<br>
My Kids (2 girls 8 & 12 are into 4H and I am one of the co-leaders <br>
this year) last year one of the 4H groups we participated in was <br>
hiking, but it wasn't very good (only one hike all year) so I <br>
figured this year I could do it better. So I took on that group as <br>
leader. Then I realized I could make it not just a hiking group but <br>
maybe a geocache group- then I realized hardly anybody would have a <br>
gps - Suddenly the light dawned and I realized our 4h club needs a <br>
letterboxing group, So I started setting up the group (lots of <br>
paperwork) So I am really into this idea and I've started planning <br>
lessons (stamp carving, orienteering, clue reading/writing) looking <br>
for various local letterboxes, planning new ones to "train" the kids <br>
on,  <br>
<br>
When word got out that I was doing something with letterboxes, <br>
somebody who knew somebody who knew someone in the local parks dept <br>
called me up and asked me what to do with a box some worker had <br>
found when the were revamping a local park. It had got turned in and <br>
sat on a shelf for a couple years. -<br>
I said send it to me. and when it arrived - it turned out to be my <br>
original Auburn Letterbox I had placed it 2000 - the last entry in <br>
the log is dec 2002.  I will replace it in the original location <br>
tonight. - <br>
<br>
anyway 4h starts up with school in September- We will be placing <br>
lots of boxes and finding those reasonably near us (we are in Meadow <br>
Vista California - About 15 Minutes NW of Auburn)<br>
<br>
If we can arrange it maybe we could have some local letterbox <br>
enthusiasts come in and talk to our group. (thats you guys)<br>
<br>
Im glad there is a Northern CA list - it was always a drag culling <br>
California messages out of all the other traffic on the LBNA list.<br>
<br>
lost my logbook so am starting over<br>

<br>
Too bad that you missed our group's event this past Saturday in Golden Gate Park. About 40 letterboxers came, and some drove quite a distance. It was a fun time, and now we have lots of new boxes hidden in GG Park!<br>
<br>
That's a great story about your Auburn letterbox. It returned to you just as you were returning to letterboxing!<br>
<br>
I believe you're located pretty close to a box that was placed by Lemony Snicket (Auburn).<br>
<br>
Once again, welcome!<br>

I'm an old 4-Her myself and my folks live in Loomis, so I'm around your area <br>
often. I'd be happy to come talk to the 4-Hers. I used to be a 4-H leader too.<br>

<br>
Interesting story! You must have been one of the first letterboxers, <br>
relatively speaking. Welcome back!!<br>
<br>
 We live in Davis and go through Auburn often on the way to Tahoe. We planted <br>
the I-80 series and a couple in Tahoe among many others. It's always good to <br>
hear about new people ready to plant boxes in the general vicinity of your <br>
home so you can hurry and find them.<br>
<br>
I think your 4H idea is a great one. You might want to put on a little <br>
mini-gathering in the fall and invite boxers with kids. We could show your 4Hers how <br>
it works! I know the letterboxspectors from Nevada City <br>
(letterboxspector@hotmaill.com) would be a great family to come, their sons are really gung-ho, <br>
judging from their enthusiasm at the GGGathing last Saturday. We could meet in <br>
Auburn at Claude Chana and get the 2 boxes that are near there then go out and <br>
plant another or 2. <br>
<br>
Just a thought.<br>
<br>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br>
but good impressions. Sir B<br>

I cannot wait to find more of your work, Matt. I'm a charter member of the fan club. <br>
Train 'em in your style and we'll have a rash of grand new letterboxes. Yay!!!<br>
