Had a great experience with the Saint Patrick series in Mendocino this<br/>
weekend.  Lovely views and great stamps!  Be forwarned that at the Van<br/>
Damme site, a large redwood has fallen "at the rise" and it's quite a<br/>
hurdle over the the tree.  I'm guessing it'll be removed sometime<br/>
soon.  Bring an extra pair of jeans, as it's nice and muddy.<br/>
<br/>
Like a couple of others, had the opportunity to look for Gift in the<br/>
Redwoods, despite the winter closure of the park.  It's currently<br/>
unmarked and we found a radar cop parked right at what we believed to<br/>
be the entrance.  When he took off after a speeding PT Cruiser, we<br/>
moved in quickly and found the treasure.  And a great one it is, too.<br/>
