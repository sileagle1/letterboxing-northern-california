How in the world did you find these photos of Oscar Bear?? This affair <br/>
occurred on the weekend of the Sacramento Gathering. Oscar and I WERE <br/>
crossing the bridge when 2 automobiles approached, one from each <br/>
direction. The vehicle traveling down hill approached much too fast, so <br/>
Oscar Bear thought it best to extracate us out of harms way. He did a <br/>
double flip over the side of the bridge. There was no panic involved. <br/>
He grabbed the arch of the bridge and pulled us up. No bears were ever <br/>
at risk during the shooting of these photographs!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately OB's extravegance drew quite a crowd so a subtle excape <br/>
was not possible. When, the next morning, they kindly lowered a net <br/>
below us we decided this would provide a perfectly acceptable escape. <br/>
<br/>
In the autumn of the year with hibernation approching, Oscar Bear <br/>
becomes quite excitable and a trip to the mountains is something we <br/>
both delight in. I have difficulty controlling him in this regard, so <br/>
the gathering was out of the question.<br/>

P.S. If I carry any weapon (which is very seldom) it is a light-saber. <br/>
My "swords" are actually rapiers, a lighter and more nible weaopn.<br/>

&gt; Maybe you native Californians are jaded to this sort of news, but this<br/>
&gt; little Marylander is totally delighted by the whole story.<br/>
