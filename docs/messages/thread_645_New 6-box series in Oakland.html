<br/>
After months of plotting, First President and I have FINALLY completed "The<br/>
Greatest Liar" series. This was a joint effort - 3 of the stamps are his<br/>
quick carvings, three are my more painstaking (but don't expect much)<br/>
efforts. This is a very sweet walk in Oakland's Joaquin Miller park - but<br/>
follow the directions, it doesn't start where you might think.<br/>
<br/>
Clues are just on LbNA - I just haven't made the time to join AtlasQuest<br/>
yet. (Okay, I know it won't take long, but I'm strapped for time, what can I<br/>
say? I also get daunted by how to list our now otherwise-named son, who is<br/>
likely to change his name when his coin hobby wanes anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
There's also a math puzzle with mailed prizes, and itty bitty finders'<br/>
prizes set up by First President. I imagine the young ones would<br/>
particularly enjoy these. Note that there are finders' prizes for various<br/>
finders, not just first finders. (That's what the math puzzle is about.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy! Write and let us know.<br/>
