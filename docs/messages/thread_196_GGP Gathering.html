The Letterboxspector family had a great time! Thank you to all who<br>
Planned, set up, and attended. Sir B, Thank you for all the info on my<br>
new camera. Hay!, what's up with cheese racing? I had to explain to my<br>
two boys that this is not something that we do on the BBQ at home!!!<br>
Haha. I will make available to anyone who wants it a digital copy of<br>
the group photo that I took, just email me and ask. My home email is<br>
tjholman2 at ncws dot com. We were able to get to three boxes, and are<br>
wondering how many are staying in the park? We would like to take our<br>
neice (Special K) down.<br>
<br>
Thanks once more,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Based upon the favorable feedback from those who took the "Hunt for the Temple of Neptune of the Lost City of Atlantis", the box will be staying in its underwater location. There may be a very tiny adjustment to one of the 2 "key" boxes (to better hide it), but it won't affect the clues at all. I published an online web version yesterday.  Here's its link:   http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/atlantis.htm<br>
<br>
I really enjoyed myself at the gathering (although all the exchanges made my head spin), and it was wonderful having faces to put with the trail names. <br>
<br>
I'm now ready to let my "find" count to finally be greater than my "plant" count... but you can expect more SF boxes from me, and as quirky as you'd expect!<br>
<br>
Take care everyone - hope to see you again soon!<br>
