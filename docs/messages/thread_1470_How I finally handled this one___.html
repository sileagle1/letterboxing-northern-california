As the other person seeking that letterbox, I was one of the first<br/>
casualties of its disclosure (after you.) I'm an extremely casual<br/>
letterboxer, but it's still a bit annoying to know it was lost from<br/>
carelessness not luck.<br/>
The NH report does make me aggravated and nervous though. It's enough<br/>
to make a girl write a nasty gram to their website. However, the last<br/>
thing we need is for frenzied authorities to clue in that there's<br/>
another sport like geocaching and find the AtlasQuest or LBNA clues.<br/>
It's always been a thorny issue with, say, national parks, but the<br/>
tone of that article really begs the issue. I was out in Middle Harbor<br/>
picking up a few left from the summer get together last weekend  when<br/>
a police helicopter flew overhead. Looking back toward where I parked,<br/>
I noticed a half dozen police cars blocking my way. They were there<br/>
for someone else, of course, but in this current climate it does give<br/>
a second's pause when you're planting or recovering. I have a box I've<br/>
been trying to plant for a few months now, that I just can't find the<br/>
right balance between 'so accessible it will get tossed' and 'so<br/>
inaccessible it will arouse suspicion.' How do others reconcile this?<br/>
