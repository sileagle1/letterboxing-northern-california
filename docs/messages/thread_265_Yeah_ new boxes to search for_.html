If you wait for it to cool off it , there could be road closures as they do not plow some of the roads. When we planted the two yesterday, and replanted one other it was 70 degrees. The biggest problem is they have closed the Trail of the Giants on the Western Divide Hwy due to tree thinning. The FS is cutting some of the pines and firs around the redwoods.<br/>
