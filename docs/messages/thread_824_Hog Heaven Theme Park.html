Oh, you beat us to it! We have a trip planned this Thursday that sounds <br>
pretty much like yours. We'll venture up Thursday after work (taking Friday <br>
off--see how important this series is?!), spend the night in Red Bluff and get up <br>
early to beat the heat on Friday. We'd like to get them all by noon or <br>
thereabouts. <br>
<br>
Although we'd planned to get this fun and amazing series of boxes no matter <br>
what (the list of placers and carvers is a real "Who's Who" of letterboxing!), <br>
hearing that they're as stellar as all that makes us really eager. Good to <br>
know about the nettles and thorns so we can dress accordingly.  Thanks!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Definitely a backpack.  No way a stroller will get through there, unless it's made by Hummer.  Also, be very careful of the heat with the little one.  There's some shade, but expect it to be easily over 100 degrees & probably over 105 during the middle of the day.  Also, it's mainly a rock plain that happens to has grass on it, so the radiant heat from the ground will still probably get you even in the shade.  <br>

What!!!! it is in a bigger box!!! Did you take your backhoe to help <br>
you with the plant? Have you ever seen anything that audacious in your <br>
letterbox finds? Thanks for the work as I'm not sure we will be going <br>
back in the near future.<br>

Hi BC,<br>
While I'm not sure about those letterboxes planted afterwards and <br>
added to the pool, I would figure one complete day + if the weather <br>
is not too hot. If you started very early in the morning and had a <br>
good day then the original bunch should be able to be found before <br>
the late afternoon. If it turns hot then I would do what you can and <br>
return another morning. While that not be what you want to do, you <br>
have to remember that eventually there will be more pigs joining the <br>
party, and you will probably return in the future in any case. Bring <br>
and drink lots of water and per the Kool Kats lace it with Mosquito <br>
repellant to your own taste. <br>
BTW wear blaze orange as hunting season is open.<br>

I'm a little disappointed that you would broadcast a Kool Kat trail<br>
survival tip that we told you in confidence, off line.  Now everyone<br>
will know.<br>
<br>
I thought you were only a little crazy in the a.m. when you first wake<br>
up.  What gives?<br>

Actually I thought it was a great idea. Just a splash of Cutter <br>
Evergreen and spring water over ice.<br>
