research the general location. There are a total of five boxes. It <br/>
isn't too long of a walk, but Lizardbutt says it is better to bike it <br/>

Lizardbutt's mom aka The Hiker<br/>

<br/>
Chorazin's Life<br/>
<br/>
Her past was of Ruin and her future of Rebirth. <br/>
<br/>
Near a Cross with her book of Prayers...<br/>
<br/>
She sailed into the new land on the rising sun and prospered.<br/>
<br/>
The ornateness and peace found here was so unique. <br/>
<br/>
The Rustic one then came to her aid.  <br/>
