Also, since Doublesaj naturally has to be a little modest regarding her other half, I will say that the event stamp was GORGEOUS! Thanks Old Blue for going over the top for us.<br/>
<br/>
And huge thanks to Sally and EVERYONE who contributed to making the event so fun (not forgetting the weather gods).<br/>

I will probably place another Boku Books order in the near future, so let me know if you want anything. You can see all their products at bokubooks.com. <br/>

Someday, maybe a few years down the road, perhaps there will be more letterboxers hailing from Nevada, and I will help to plan a gathering in Virginia City, Nevada--the Virginia City Invasion or something. You'll have to do a little traveling, but that's part of what this game is about, isn't it? In the meantime I guess you can always go to Ell-Ay.<br/>
