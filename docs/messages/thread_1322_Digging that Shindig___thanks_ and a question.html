<br/>
It was so sweet to spend time with everyone who has been so supportive<br/>
of me and Robb during the past six months.  This was the longest<br/>
outing that Robb and I have had since his accident, and I just wish<br/>
that I had been able to thank everyone who sent kind wishes either to<br/>
Robb in the hospital, or via the blog.<br/>
<br/>
So what do you all think?  Should I leave "Palm Trees Equal Camels,<br/>
Right?" in place?  Or do you think it will disappear?  Without giving<br/>
anything away, we think we'll reverse the orientation of the baggie,<br/>
so that the apeture will be on the bottom of the package.   We think<br/>
this would be better for the rainy season.  (I also think that I'll<br/>
re-package "Hey Sailor" so that it can be stashed in a smaller space.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I'll be returning to Middle Shoreline Park, because I<br/>
wasn't able to pick up half of the event's letterboxes.  I feel like I<br/>
didn't do half of what I might have in terms of socializing with all<br/>
you nice folks, locating your beautiful and devious letterboxes, and<br/>
taking photos of any of this event.<br/>
<br/>
I just can't get over how smoothly run, and really enjoyable this<br/>
event was!  <br/>
<br/>
And the letterboxes!  Wow!  I have to particularly praise Dem XX Men,<br/>
for their wonderfully demented creations.  I'm sorry that Paul in SF<br/>
and the ever-mysterious OB Juan were unable to join us.  (Have a great<br/>
time in Romania Paul....Transylvania is my father's father's father's<br/>
father-land.)  I didn't get to play Boggle, but Lea's stamps were just<br/>
glorious, and it was so nice of her to share them with everyone who<br/>
stayed to the end of the event.  Esmecat's beautiful book and stamps<br/>
were a lovely thing.  And thank you to Mimulus, who brought the circus<br/>
to town.  (If I didn't mention your letterbox, it is probably because<br/>
I was too mucy yakkety yakking to find your letterbox...or because the<br/>
coffee hasn't penetrated the deeper parts of my brain.)<br/>
<br/>
When I do, eventually, locate my personal traveller, I'll let you the<br/>
group know, so that the clever folks who composed limericks and nutty<br/>
puns can send me their addresses, and I'll send along a print.  (Those<br/>
of you who met Bandaid for Thai food a while back can count that image<br/>
as a "find," now!)<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
Lisa<br/>
