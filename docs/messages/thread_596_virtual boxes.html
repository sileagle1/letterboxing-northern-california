Well it took me hours and hours, since I do not read dragon <br/>
literature, and some hints from nicknamerinSF but I finally got the <br/>
dragon box....and the irony is I just came from a family night <br/>
dinner with our play group friends and one of the dads is a huge fan <br/>
of dragon lit and named his daughter after one of the princess's <br/>
mentioned in one of the books, He probably could have whipped thru <br/>
it in 20 minutes too...  Well we all have our niches of <br/>
expertise...perhaps I should do a virtual letterbox on Linnean <br/>
botanical nomenclature<br/>
<br/>
Mimulus (of the Scrophulariacea Family..that's Snapdragon to you)<br/>
