We think of Greenhorn cave as being closer to Lake Isabella than to <br/>
Bakersfield. Next time you manage to hit the Kern Valley you can try <br/>
out the little Deep Creek Cave by following our Roy Rogers LB clues. <br/>
The FS has blocked off the entrance to save us all from the peril <br/>
that lays within, but you are thin enough to skinny by the gate. <br/>
Gwen and I have long since been unable to enter, but still remember <br/>
the cool little waterfall inside.<br/>

Oh, it's definitely closer to Lake Isabella.  I was just trying to <br/>
