event came together so well, and we are looking forward to welcoming <br>
everyone, some of whom are traveling from a distance to be with us.<br>
<br>
There will be (at least) 20 letterboxes in the park (plus an event <br>
stamp), and we have received RSVPs from about 40 people, including a <br>
number of Time Newbies.  The site will be marked by a display of orange <br>
and lime green balloons, so it will be hard to miss.  A few reminders:<br>
<br>
- For those who have planted boxes, please remember to bring copies of <br>
the clues with you to distribute.<br>
- Lunch is Bring Your Own, including drinks, utensils, etc. (we are <br>
providing hot coals)<br>
- There is only one table at the site - please bring blankets or fold <br>
up chairs to sit on.<br>
- Weather is predicted to be in the 60s - but it's San Francisco so <br>
dress in layers!<br>
- Please try to be at the site at 12:00 for the most important event of <br>
the day: the Group Photo!<br>
<br>
See you tomorrow!  Your planning committee,<br>
<br>
