                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Airports often have really great curators!  I've never flown<br>
from Sacramento, but we've got friends visiting later this spring who<br>
will be coming through.  I'll have to tell them to keep their eyes open!<br>
<br>
If only this *weren't* at an airport (and crawling with TSA guards),<br>
it would be a great place to hide a mico-mini letterbox.  I see lots<br>
of crevices between the suitcases!<br>

Did Team Bear Cat contact any of you?  They're in the area this<br>
weekend, and will be doing some boxing.<br>
