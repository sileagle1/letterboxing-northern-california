Princess Lea has the right idea! You just have to get out there and <br>
box! Yeah, it took a while to clean all the mud off my hiking boots <br>
when we got home and I did do a little skate-n-slide along the way <br>
(which entertained Old Blue, always at my side) but we ended up with <br>
12 boxes and an HH in 2 days. Here's a list of what's alive and well:<br>
<br>
Charming Chapeau and Sedate Sedan (by Grumpy Grinch) and Nancy Takes <br>
Manhattan and Big Apple (by Amanda from Seattle) in Antioch, CA, The <br>
Old Sacramento Cemetery by Chantt (in Sacramento, of course). The <br>
rest, all in Lodi by Grumpy Grinch: Lodi Libation, Blushing <br>
Butterfly, Pretty Posy, Downstream Drifter, Shy Squirrel, Little <br>
Lamplight and Basic Bunny (love that alliteration!).<br>
<br>
We managed to plant one too (making P 50 for us!), along with the <br>
rest on the lovely hike in Antioch. If you can't find the clues to <br>
all these boxes, don't forget to check that masterfully comprehensive <br>
site, www.atlasquest.com ! In fact, you'll need to do so if you want <br>
the clues to the box we planted!<br>
<br>
Happy Boxing New Year to you all!!<br>
