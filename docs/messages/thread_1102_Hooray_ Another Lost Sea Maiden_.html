                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, a little cajoling I did actually worked. A number of people have <br>
remarked that RedSF should plant more boxes, and that they liked the <br>
Lost Sea Maiden #1 a lot.<br>
<br>
So... I put a bug in RedSF's ear via an Atlasquest message, and <br>
thankfully, she took action, and now Lost Sea Maiden #2 has been <br>
planted!<br>
<br>
Hey! We like your boxes, and want more... don't be shy! MORE, please!<br>
<br>
I suspect there's a Lost Sea Maiden #3 coming, right?<br>
