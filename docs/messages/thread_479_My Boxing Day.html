After getting up early to do laundry, dishes, garbage, bury the dead <br/>
chicken (boo hoo, Boco...our bantam cochin died yesterday) and <br/>
various onerous chores, I treated myself to a day of boxing with my <br/>
son.  We hit 7 boxes...in a big loop from our house to Napa and back <br/>
again.  Zin Country, Angel Wine, Aristacat, Westwood Hills, <br/>
Napa...not wine and a basement box which I think I can adopt and <br/>
repost.  Is that kosher?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the kind words from the Sugarloafers on Sunday.  I got an <br/>
email from de Kool Kats that they ended up doing the entire 7 mile <br/>
plus loop (with Gray Pine Country)  and did the part from Pluto on <br/>
in the DARK!  What brave and hardy souls...altho I guess if you are <br/>
on the trail and it gets dark you dont have much choice unless you <br/>
want to bivouac on the trsil for the night.  What awesome <br/>
dedication!  <br/>
<br/>
Then again, I found a box the cool cats had found last fall at <br/>
Westwood where they mention in the logbook finding it with a <br/>
flashlight at 9 olock at night.  Maybe they prefer LB in the dark!<br/>

There was nothing brave or hardy about it!!  But somehow or another we<br/>
get ourselves in these ridiculus situations.  I was seriously worried<br/>
last night.  It was so dark in there and we could not see the trail or<br/>
know for sure that we were even on it.  I walked through water twice<br/>
because I couldn't see to step over it.  The trail was pretty soggy<br/>
most of the way down.  Mim, as only you would know, Westwood Hills<br/>
does not even hold a candle to Sugarloaf Ridge.  At the time, Westwood<br/>
Hills seemed like quite a feat doing it in the dark, now it would seem<br/>
like a "piece of cake." <br/>
<br/>
We found out that our new cell phones with great coverage are useless<br/>
back there.<br/>
<br/>
We are laughing about it today, but last night was a little worrisome.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should change our name to something like Day and Night Boxers<br/>
or Midnight Duo or maybe just get smart and box while the sun is<br/>
shining brightly.  I think I need to start a diary called the Trials<br/>
and Tibulations of Da Kool Kats Boxin' Days.<br/>

I wondered about you and Gary - we didn't see you as we finished up our bit of boxing yesterday and Wascally Wabbit was asking about you...after coming down from Neptune - can't imagine coming down in the dark!  Seriously, glad you both are ok.  As I recall - I think we stamped into some boxes in Lodi that you visted in the dark as well????  It does seem like a frequent scenario for you all!  Aren't wild cats predominantly nocturnal???  You are just living up to your name perhaps!  It was lovely to meet you and Gary - looking forward to the gathering!<br/>

Well, I had forgotten about the Lodi boxes in the dark plus we did get<br/>
locked in a park in Lodi that was suppose to close up at 5:00 but<br/>
since it was a nasty rainy day and it looked like it was too dark for<br/>
anyone to be in there, I guess they locked the gates early, not<br/>
expecting anyone to be in.  That was a tough one, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Then we drove all the way up to pick up Funhog's box in Glenn Co and<br/>
walked out of that one in the dark.  We picked up several in SLO in<br/>
the dark.  When you drive that far, you just don't want to stop.  All<br/>
of the ones that we did down there (SLO) were safe ones, plus my son<br/>
and daughter-in-law was with us.  Where were they yesterday?!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'd just forgotten how many we have done in the dark.  We just<br/>
seize whatever opportunity we can find.<br/>
