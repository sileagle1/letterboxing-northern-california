Good for you for adding incentive instead of changing clues! I won't get<br>
to search for it for awhile, but I will look forward to being confused<br>

Ha ha!! That was us!! <br>
<br>
Just so everyone knows - these clues are as AWESOME as they are <br>
hard. Its the kind where you feel so brillant once you've figured <br>
them out.<br>
<br>
We have them about 90% figured out - we'll be back this weekend and <br>
hopefully will be there considerably less time.<br>
<br>
We've had a great time just with the clues!! Thanks Black Cavalier!<br>
