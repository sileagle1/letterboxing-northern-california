Ha ha!! That was us!! <br/>
<br/>
Just so everyone knows - these clues are as AWESOME as they are <br/>
hard. Its the kind where you feel so brillant once you've figured <br/>
them out.<br/>
<br/>
We have them about 90% figured out - we'll be back this weekend and <br/>
hopefully will be there considerably less time.<br/>
<br/>
We've had a great time just with the clues!! Thanks Black Cavalier!<br/>
