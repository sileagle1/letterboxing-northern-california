I suspected the Beans box was there, but after crawling about fro 5 <br>
minutes or so, he mo-blow-and-go guys pulled up and started unloading <br>
their lawnmowers. I decided it wouldbe best to go so as not attrack <br>
attention. <br>
<br>
 Princess Lea is right, that place is white glove clean, I suspect <br>
they spray the grass with some sort of polish so as not make even <br>
grass stains on clothes.  I also think my jellybean high could have <br>
interfered with my searching ability.  Boy, are they generous with the <br>
free samples...or maybe that is just Easter week when they really dole <br>
it out.  <br>
<br>
I had the good fortune of finding Moonrabbits altoids tin...really <br>
great camoflauge...I love boxes out in the open like that...so <br>
brazen!  Long may it live.<br>
