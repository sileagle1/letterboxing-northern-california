Sleepy Cat and I went down to the Monterey peninsula yesterday as I was on a pilgrimage <br/>
to get Jay Drew's Wharf Cat stamp.  We hit several of Mtnbikemann's boxes on the way and <br/>
achieved our goal up on Tortilla Flats of that amazing cat stamp.  We moved on to Pacific <br/>
Grove and got so horribly lost (in a dog park!) that we ended up in Pebble Beach.  Luckily <br/>
we realized we were very close to another LB so we nabbed that one before finally getting <br/>
back and persevering in getting Sporty's Play Day.  That one should have been a drive by, <br/>
but I think it took us almost 1 1/2 hours.  Duh.<br/>
<br/>
Then we went to Carmel for Kat from Moab's cute little This Old Man Came Rolling Home <br/>
series.  I would love to have gotten her other boxes in town but the sun was down and we <br/>
didn't bring out flashlight or the Kool Kats with us to help find boxes in the dark.  So, I'll <br/>
have to come down another day - am glad to see the area growing so nicely.  I was there <br/>
about 18 months ago and there were only a handful of boxes to find at the time.  The only <br/>
ones I found missing were Free Flying and Wags &amp; Tails.<br/>

<br/>
What LB's will you be looking for? I checked both sites for Point Reyes and<br/>
did not come up with anything. Also, is there a lot of hiking? My wife does<br/>
not do well on a long hikes.<br/>
