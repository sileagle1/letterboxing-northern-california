                    <div class="plaintext-content">Egads, I feel like I have been everywhere and nowhere.  We have been <br/>
busy, just got back from a famliy visit to the East coast this time <br/>
and only looked for/found one box the whole visit.  A Funhog box, <br/>
called Let's Play, where I was able to safely leave the Golden Goose.  <br/>
I see that someone else has already found Let's Play so I assume he is <br/>
on his way winging over New England.  I also noticed the Pepe's <br/>
planted a box in Bennington, in the same park as a Princess Lea box. <br/>
<br/>
I have been very remiss in finding all the new Bay area boxes.  I <br/>
gotta drop everythign and go find Paul's boxes before anymore go <br/>
missig.  I especially look foward to Vertigo and Minotaur Maze: Urban <br/>
tree appreciation and architectural hair-splitting are just my thing.  <br/>
<br/>
We are also trying to pull together a trip to New Zealand in <br/>
november...so if anyone would like to send a box or hitchhiker there I <br/>
can plant it for you.  <br/>
