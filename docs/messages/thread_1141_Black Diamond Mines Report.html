                    <div class="plaintext-content">We decided today was a perfect day for a hike so we headed to the <br/>
Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve.  We checked on Charming <br/>
Chapeau and found it dry and well, though a bit lonely.  No one has <br/>
visited since last October.<br/>
<br/>
Sedate Sedan is missing.  It will not be replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Found the correct tree for the Black Diamond Letterbox but found no <br/>
box.  There has been a lot of limb pruning done recently on this <br/>
tree.  We have contacted the placers so they can verify.<br/>
<br/>
We were very happy to find Strike It Rich, Homage to the Past, and <br/>
the Hopeful Miner.  Some very fine carving on all 3.  Also found the <br/>
Calling All Boxes hitchhiker, which we shall send on its way <br/>
elsewhere sometime soon.<br/>
<br/>
There was a tourbus full of senior hikers in the preserve.  It was <br/>
nice to see lots of others enjoying this magnificent location.  And <br/>
there is no fee during the week.  <br/>
