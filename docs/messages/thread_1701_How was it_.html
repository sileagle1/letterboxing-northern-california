It was a totally full weekend.  We went full out from 11:30 am Friday <br>
until 3:30 pm Sunday.  Our heads were spinning trying to decide where <br>
to look for boxes, there were so many and so many clues that needed <br>
to be deciphered.  Everyone had to balance how much searching for <br>
boxes they wanted to do vs. visit and do exchanges.  We ended up with <br>
around 50 boxes found,  around 30 exchanges, and hours and hours <br>
spent on beautiful forest trails and just talking with people.<br>
<br>
There were groups of cabins in several locations.  Some of us had to <br>
walk between 1/4 and 1/3 of a mile to the dining hall for meals.  <br>
Others were right there.  A few cabins had a Sasquatch recording <br>
playing loudly in the woods nearby day and night.  Those of us <br>
farther away were spared the noise.  Trails varied from wide, <br>
relatively flat, easy walks to very steep, rocks tracks crossed <br>
frequently by fallen trees.  Everywhere were beautiful cedars, <br>
maples, firs, and other hardwoods.  Bugs were practically invisible.  <br>
Banana slugs could be found if one looked carefully.  There were no <br>
muggles anywhere around, so one could talk letterboxing and search <br>
the woods day and night with no problem.<br>
<br>
On the downside were the late night parties, loud snores and 2 am <br>
showers just on the other side of one's sleeping quarters.  But then, <br>
some might not consider those to be downsides.....<br>
<br>
We left exhausted, exhilarated, and totally ready to do it again.<br>
