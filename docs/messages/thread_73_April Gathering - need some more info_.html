You're considering travelling 2,000 miles to attend a letterboxing <br/>
event!!!  Well, I will say the last (and 1st) event I ever attended <br/>
was an incredible blast, hosted by incredible people, in a terrific <br/>
location, with gorgeous letterboxes to be found, but for me that was <br/>
only a 400 mile round-trip (SLO-Stamping in the Meadow LB Event). <br/>
I'll be at Kernville, and if you're there, I hope to receive such <br/>
dedicated letterboxer's X-change stamps.<br/>

AND the destination!  ;)  If the destination involves meeting other <br/>
LBers, it's just icing on the cake!  I just LBers are pretty cool <br/>
people!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I just found out I have to go to Southern Louisiana for a week <br/>
in a few months--and I even considered driving the 2,700 miles one <br/>
way for it just so we could letterbox along the way (imagine all the <br/>
cool places we could visit along the way!!!).  After realizing it <br/>
would take over 5 days driving 500 miles each (without deviating for <br/>
letterboxes along the way) just to get there (with 2 young kids in <br/>
the car), I reconsidered my temporary mental lapse and will fly <br/>
there instead.  If I had all the time in the world, you'd better <br/>
believe I'd have driven it.  So, yes, this hobby has certainly <br/>
changed our mindset--is it dedication?  Nah, probably more like <br/>
mental issues...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hoping we will be able to juggle our schedule &amp; finances so we can <br/>
attend.  After all, we need an excuse to go check on our Northern CA <br/>
letterboxes in the process...  ;)  Hope to see you then,<br/>

If this message gets out before 3/9 then we found one. For info regarding the Kernville gathering in April you can go to Silent Dougs web site and most of your questions will be answered. A 9 year old should be able to go rafting BUT you would have to rent an appropriate PFD (life jacket) from one of the outdoor stores in town as we do not have any that small. A 5 1/2 tear old would be pretty iffy. and would make the guide extremely nervous. A 2 1/2 year old would not be able to go rafting but frazzeled mothers would be okay. Several camping areas are listed in the info sheet that is posted on Silent Dougs web site. When we get back to Kernville we will be able to handle you questions.<br/>
