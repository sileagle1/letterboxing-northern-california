Thanks to Alien Explorers for their wonderful gesture of placing a companion <br>
box to Planet Walk,  And beautiful stamps!  I went today to visit Abamit and to <br>
try to go place the last 3 boxes for Gray Pine Trail but got rained out.  <br>
<br>
So Princess Lea try to hold off visiting north again (or anyone else for that <br>
matter) until I can get them placed.....hopefully Tuesday this week.  It is <br>
amazing how having a few tupperware containers with a stamp and logbook <br>
in my backpack can transform me into a hiking Amazon woman.  I just can't <br>
rest until I get them safely hidden and the clues posted.  Then the obsession <br>
wanes for a few days until I get an idea for another series and then it starts all <br>
over again.  I am neglecting other areas of my life I am afraid.  But I would <br>
much rather carve stamps and go hiking than rebalance my 401K (? ha ha) or <br>
fold laundry.  <br>
<br>
Does anyone else feel this way?   <br>
<br>
I still don't know my PFAH count, (I suspect much lower to Artrekker's who has <br>
been boxing 3 months shy of me) and nowhere near Princess Lea's and <br>
Doublesaj and Old Blue's.  It is great to have wonderful role models out there. <br>
<br>
So it is the end of winter break and i never made it to the napa Valley to look <br>
for the boxes there. Oh well, like Wascally Wabbit says, you gotta spread it <br>
out, save some boxes for other outings.  <br>
<br>
thanks to everyone in the Bay Area who make letterboxing happen.  <br>
By the way, are Tara and Paul in Sf still out there?  Or away for the holidays?<br>
<br>
Happy New Year and Peace and health to all, <br>

We have returned and hit the trail....or more likely squished through the trail.  It is nice to be back in such a box rich environment!  <br>
 <br>
Yesterday we attempted The Carousel's Pink Treat - found the spot, but no box.  Moved on and found T it up...is that stamp supposed to be superimposed (is that even the right word??) upon itself?  Just wondering.  It was in great shape.  We were eager for more so jumped over to nab the Message in The Haunted Mansion series and found them all.  Very soggy and were thankful for one of those porches on Wyman street!  Some of the log books were full.  If I had not had so much rain running through my ears I probably would have remembered exactly which logbooks were full to help Princess Lea out...but I didn't.  Very sorry!<br>
 <br>
Today - we HAD to go and grab Birds #1 and 2!  Terrific stamps - loved the size!  Basically loved the whole experience...clues, stamp, logbook, presentation, location - could be the perfect boxes for me!  Moved on to grab Bodega Dunes LB and then Deers of West Dartmoor.  It was a beautiful day of boxing...in spite of the weather.<br>
 <br>
True to our word, while home in Louisiana we did indeed plant our first four boxes to try to get things happening in northern Louisiana.  Now we know how hard it is to set those stamps free!  We need to work on our logbooks - they were too big!  oh well....  We look forward to planting here soon - <br>
 <br>
Thanks for everything - and a great 2005 of boxing to everyone!<br>

Thanks for the compliment, Mimulus, but it is WE who are in awe of YOUR "P" <br>
count!! Not only have you placed enough for everyone in these parts to make it <br>
spectacularly worth it to "get out and box" but your carvings are superb!! <br>
We thank you so much for that!<br>
<br>
I emailed Tara this week and received an email back from her. She's been <br>
really suffering from her horrible migraines. You wouldn't happen to have any <br>
tricks in your herbal bag for her would you?<br>
