Feb 28, 2004--This box has been replaced after being reported <br/>
missing. Since it is in an entirely new location with a new stamp, <br/>
you can count another "F" if you've gotten this one before!<br/>
<br/>
You've heard of Route 66? Well, U.S. 40 was a highway stretching from <br/>
Harrison Street in Downtown San Francisco all the way to Atlantic <br/>
City, NJ way back when. It is one of the most important and historic <br/>
highways in the U.S. It was the first federally funded road and <br/>
comprised the western half of the Lincoln Highway. From 1926 to 1964, <br/>
U.S. 40 was a transcontinental highway and its route covered a lot of <br/>
American history. It followed the Oregon Trail and the ruts from the <br/>
covered wagons could be seen from cars going down the road at high <br/>
speeds. The highway followed in many places the route of the ill-<br/>
fated Donner party and went through the pass that bears their name. <br/>
It also went right next to Sutter's Mill in Sacramento where the <br/>
discovery of gold changed the course of US history. <br/>
<br/>
Before Interstate 80 was built in the late 60s, you had to take this <br/>
highway to get to Lake Tahoe. Old Blue made this day-long trip from <br/>
the S.F. Bay area many times in his youth and this I-80 series <br/>
commemorates these trips. So, if you're traveling to (or from) Lake <br/>
Tahoe, we hope this series will entertain you. For the 5 boxes in <br/>
this series, you'll only log about 6 miles off the freeway! <br/>
<br/>
Box #1 Old U.S. 40 <br/>
Rating<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
Terrain: paved, easy<br/>
Distance: less than one mile drive off the freeway, and you can see <br/>
the box's hiding place from your parked car.<br/>
<br/>
To the box: Eastbound--Exit Maple St. off I-80 in Auburn, Ca. (West <br/>
bound--exit Ophir Rd., make a left turn and reenter the freeway <br/>
eastbound then exit at Maple St.) Bear right on to Lincoln Way, aka <br/>
Old US 40, through a bit of old town. At the stop, make a left, <br/>
continue 100 paces (which is quite difficult to do in a car) and turn <br/>
right into a public parking lot and park. Behind you is the old <br/>
Placer County Seat (now a museum). In front of you "Jury Parking". <br/>
