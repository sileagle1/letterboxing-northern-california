<br/>
Mission Santa Barbara, by Sierra Sally: we were first finders on this <br/>
box! Logbook was soaked so we dried it out and bagged the logbook. <br/>
Great stamp!<br/>
Mission La Purisima Conception, by Sierra Sally:	First finders <br/>
again great stamp and found the Unicycle HH.<br/>
Ocean"o", by Judy from AG, Sleepy Cat and Princess Lea:	Found in <br/>
great shape!<br/>
Shady Coyote, by Don and Gwen:	Found in great shape!<br/>
BMW OH-2, by Maddogbmw: Found also in great shape! Cool stamp but we <br/>
drove our Mini Cooper to get to it.<br/>
The Bookstore Box, by Ryan Carpenter: Alive and well, had to buy <br/>
books to cover our actions! Fun box!<br/>
Fluttering Kings, by jennby:	we had a tough time finding this one, <br/>
but we did. Box is in great shape.<br/>
Santa Ines Mission, by Sierra Sally:	Again first find, this is a <br/>
must series we enjoyed the ones we found and the missions. Thanks <br/>
Sierra Sally for the fun.<br/>
Drove to the Nojoque Falls and the Turtle box by Don and Gwen: but <br/>
found The Solvang Letterbox by Amanda from Seattle's box. Not sure <br/>
what happened with the Turtle?<br/>
We attempted the Los Osos Oaks series. We didn't find the first box <br/>
and due to use both wearing shorts and all the poison oak around we <br/>
gave up. Next trip!<br/>
Painted Cave, by Don and Gwen: we could not find this one, not sure <br/>
if it is missing or we just missed on the clues. The cave and the <br/>
drive were great!<br/>
We wish we had had more time to find more boxes in the central coast.<br/>
We did plant a box in Pismo Beach, look for the clues soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Jam n' Jelly <br/>
