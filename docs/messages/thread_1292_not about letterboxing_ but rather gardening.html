                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just given a small urban garden, and wanted to ask Mimulus and<br>
ArtTrekker (and any others with opinions) about where to start<br>
educating myself about native California plants.<br>
<br>
I'm a very good east coast gardener, but my experience of gardening in<br>
those seasons is turned inside-out by the climate out here.  <br>
<br>
Any books I should check out from the library?<br>
<br>
Any resouces for native plant nurseries in the East Bay?<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to find tough flowering plants that will please butterflies<br>
and hummingbirds, and will make a nice oasis for the staff of Berkeley<br>
Rep's scenic studios.<br>
<br>
The garden is out behind the warehouse where out new studios are<br>
located.  We're literally at the feet of the freeway, so I imagine<br>
that the soil will be poisonous.  In addition to the vast collection<br>
of junk, there is a jasmine, a scrubby (and huge) rose bush, that<br>
fuzzy purple sage, and another huge flowering bush that I don't know<br>
the name of.  And three or four broken wheelbarrows that will be<br>
re-incarnated as planters.  We've got a garden hose outlet, and I<br>
haven't had time to figure out the schedule of the sunlight.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not a great gardener, but I"m pretty sure there is a book specifically<br>
about native plants of the east bay...  I think I saw it at Berkeley<br>
Horticultural Nursery.  I know they have a handout about butterfly gardens.<br>
I love going to this place and the people that work there have always been<br>
great.  berkeleyhort.com<br>

Good luck with your new garden.<br>

(Sigh, thinking about gardens makes me feel guilty about the sad, sad state<br>
of my backyard.)<br>

Definity get your hands on a copy of Sunset Magazine's Western Garden <br>
Book. It's thick, definitive, full of all sorts of info on soil, <br>
pests, matching plants with environment, and how to care for hundreds <br>
of plants that grown on the West Coast. Goes for $32.95, but I'll bet <br>
Amazon will have used copies.<br>
<br>
California poppies are always a sure bet. They can also be found in <br>
red, white-cream, and yellows, as well as the traditional orange-gold. <br>
They self-seed, so they come back year after year.<br>
