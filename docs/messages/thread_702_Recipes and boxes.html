really yummy.<br/>

Inspired by the multitude of box styles, I ran amock at the dollar <br/>
store in SF's Japantown.  Sadly, at least one style doesn't stay <br/>
closed at all (the little pastel coffin-shaped boxes). But since they <br/>
were three for a dollar, I can't be too disappointed.<br/>

I was out in Golden Gate Park with a pal on Sunday, and we located <br/>
Where the Buffalo Roam.  (The logbook is full!)  We failed to find the <br/>
Stole My Tarts box.  I wonder if it may be missing, because I *think* <br/>
I had the correct location.  We were also run off the "hedgehog <br/>
course" by a not very friendly groundskeeper. <br/>
<br/>
My brain is still whirling from Saturday.  <br/>

I'm g lad you discovered this shop in Japantown - it's where I load up <br/>
on boxes.  The only unfortunate thing is that they will have one model <br/>
in stock one day, but once they run out they are all gone and a new <br/>
model comes in next time.  I still am not entirely sure WHAT I'm <br/>
supposed to be putting in those boxes in real life - 2 mini carrots <br/>
maybe?<br/>

Thanks for this report.  Someone recently reported it missing and I was <br/>
all bummed out.  Glad to know it's still alive and well - I'll try and <br/>
get the FOURTH logbook out there someday soon.<br/>
