When you can have that much fun in that much heat--what was it--96*? <br/>
Seems cool compared to the 106* it was when we got home to Davis. <br/>

Thanks to all we newly met and those who're becoming treasured friends.<br/>

I wholeheartedly agree! What a wonderful gathering.<br/>
Mimulus, thank you so much for opening your home to<br/>
us. And the food everyone brought was terrific. I came<br/>
home and told me mom about the hot dogs, the cucumber<br/>
salad, the yummy lasagna, the vegetable caserole, the<br/>
vegetable platter, the awesome spinach dip (Michelle,<br/>
can we have your recipe??), the delectable fruit<br/>
salad, the scrumptious brownies, the delicious apple<br/>
pie, and the iced tea, and she said, "What a<br/>
spread!"...and it was!  Gee, did I do anything but<br/>
eat?! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to each of you who brought a traveler.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone missed getting the event stamp, please let<br/>
me know and I will mail you an image.<br/>
<br/>
It was a pleasure seeing most of you again and meeting<br/>
Steve and Forman, and Katie and her mom for the first<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being wonderful people =)<br/>

<br/>
Mim - your hospitality was GREAT!  The rug in the porta potty was <br/>
especially homey!  The Porta Potty box was hilarious and fun!  <br/>
Disgruntled Couple was a hoot and the Goin' to the Fair "box" was <br/>
definitely a work of art!  Ditto that comment!!!<br/>
<br/>
What do you all say to a recipe swap?<br/>
If you want - send them to me - I'll combine them into one email and <br/>
mail it out to everyone?  OR do we want to send it to everyone so ALL <br/>
can enjoy our great food as it comes through?!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Moonrabbit - loved the "ticket" logbook!!!!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you 'round the boxes soon!<br/>
