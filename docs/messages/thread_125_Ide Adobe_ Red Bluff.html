Hey Hog, sorry this one is mia as it was one of our favorite hides.<br/>
Ryan's comments in the log were right on. I hope you can find a spot <br/>
to rehide as the location is really neat.<br/>

gre up down there, and it reminded me of the obligatory field trip <br/>
there (there aren't a lot of field trip destinations around those <br/>
parts!). <br/>
<br/>
What was really interesting is that my folks are involved with the <br/>
historical society, and have picture of the construction of the <br/>
little structure that was its home. One of the best hiding places <br/>
we've seen!<br/>
