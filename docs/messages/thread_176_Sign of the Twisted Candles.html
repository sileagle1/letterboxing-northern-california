really like the clues, but in the year it was up there I never received <br/>

As for the 7/31 gathering, I have 5 definite boxes so far, with the <br/>

names in the world of letterboxing!)  Hope you can make it<br/>

please feel free to contact me before you hunt for one of my boxes as I <br/>
may have recent information about its status!  Can't remember if I <br/>
mentioned it on the list yet, but Chococat has been retired and is no <br/>
longer listed on the LB web site.  Based on the response, I probably <br/>
will replace Twisted Candles..... someday.<br/>
<br/>
Did everyone see the Time Magazine article this week about <br/>
letterboxing?  Our own Ryan is quoted, and I'm trying to figure out:  <br/>
Buzzard, is your name really Barry?  I liked that the writer emphasized <br/>
the secrecy aspect - maybe that will result in keeping our boxes safe.<br/>
<br/>
Event update:  I currently have confirmed reports of 16 boxes that will <br/>
be at GGP on the 31st!<br/>

Hi Princess Lea,<br/>
I'm suffering greatly at the fact that I'm going to miss your <br/>
gathering; just can't swing a trip to San Francisco right now, and I <br/>
know there will be some LBers up there that I'd like to see.  Yes, <br/>
I'm Barry the Buzzard from Pasadena. That's a pretty big article in <br/>
Time magazine for letterboxing; I thought it'd be some two paragraph <br/>
side item.  Since it gave the letterboxing.org web address, can you <br/>
imagine how many hits that server is going to take? The site will <br/>
probably be down for the next couple of weeks!  Let's hope the <br/>
thousands of looky-loos (don't know how to spell that word) who run <br/>
out to check a local box don't screw 'em up too badly.  If it starts <br/>
being a problem, we'll all just have to post tougher clues to solve, <br/>
so the casual vandal will content themselves with spray painting some <br/>
wall instead of spending two hours deciphering a cryptogram. <br/>
<br/>
I saw your Nancy Drew buddy at Kernville, and she's been down to <br/>
Pasadena a couple of times and stamped into my boxes. Say hi to her <br/>
and that dude she hikes with for me at the gathering. It sounds like <br/>
it'll be a great event!<br/>

I went to Borders to buy the Time Magazine and the article wasn't in there. <br/>
It was dated 7/19/04, what was the date on the mag with the famous Buzzard in <br/>
it?  I spent $74 on books instead, and I don't read. <br/>

Sorry to hear we won't be seeing you at the Golden Gate Gathering. Are you <br/>
going to work on a Griffith Park Gathering? I'll help if you do.<br/>

The article is in the July 26th issue of Time; I picked up a copy <br/>
yesterday (or four copies).  Thank god for this week's cover, last <br/>
week's Time cover was boring political stuff, whereas this week's <br/>
cover is LAS VEGAS!!!!  Shhhh about the Griffith Park Gathering, this <br/>
is a secret fantasy scenario that no one in SoCal is ready to take on <br/>
yet. But thank you for your support, and it will be greatfully <br/>
accepted when said event does comes to pass.  I'm thinking the fall; <br/>
can't have too many events crowding each other, and parts of Southern <br/>
California are at their best in the fall (maybe around Halloween, my <br/>
favorite holiday).<br/>
<br/>
The fact that I'm missing the SF Gathering is pissing me off royally, <br/>
which is coming across to various folks I've been emailing, but I <br/>
suppose there will be more events in the future--heavy sigh.  Well, I <br/>
guess I better stop talking and start carving some more "unique <br/>
stamps." Help me somebody!<br/>
