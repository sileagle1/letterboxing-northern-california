"Coberly was still watching the commotion when a tow truck came to haul <br/>
the 24-foot motor home from the scene. It was driven by the same man <br/>
who had pulled the big rig from her garage six months earlier."<br/>
<br/>
Including the info on the tow truck driver might be the best part? Or <br/>
maybe the realization by Coberly?<br/>
Only in Lodi! or not.<br/>

ROFL!!<br/>

I don't know what's funnier, the scatting scat musician or the<br/>
professional disrober on wheels at the wheel.<br/>
<br/>
You have to live near there to get how completely hysterical this is.<br/>
