<br>
	Hi,<br>
	<br>
	Just so everyone is clear, my permit for Alum Rock Park does not<br>
<br>
	permit:<br>
	<br>
	1) alcohol<br>
	2) amplified music<br>
	3) collection of entrance fees to the event<br>
	4) sale of goods<br>
	<br>
	So, whatever you choose to do is your business, please just<br>
refrain <br>
	from doing it in Chaparral or Ramada. This permit cost a few<br>
clams <br>
	and I don't particularly want to be fined for violating the<br>
terms.<br>
	<br>
	So, to be clear, the discussion about cookies is not part of the<br>
<br>
	official gathering. <br>
	<br>
	Thanks,<br>
	Reee<br>

Thank goodness for your irreverence!!  Hey, it was pointed out that the<br>
place will be infested with "muggles", so I figured we need not draw<br>
the ire of Ranger Bob.  I just want to sleep in the hammock all day!!<br>
<br>
My hubby will be bummed to learn that the "entertainment" has been<br>
cancelled!  :)<br>
<br>
Let me see if I can locate my sense of humor.....where did I leave it<br>
again??<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
