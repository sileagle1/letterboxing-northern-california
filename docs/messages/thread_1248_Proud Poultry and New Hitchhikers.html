                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just read in our local paper that the location of our Proud Poultry <br/>
Mystery Box is to be closed early in 2007.  If you've been thinking <br/>
about looking for it, better do so soon!<br/>
<br/>
Several of our letterboxes have had to be retired recently, usually <br/>
due to erosion or other damage to their home sites.  Rather than let <br/>
them languish in a box, we have decided to turn them into hitchhikers. <br/>
Hope you enjoy finding them here and there.  Please help them to <br/>
travel. <br/>
