Grandchildren yesterday.  We hadn't been to Alameda in awhile and <br>
noticed many new boxes to lure us there.  Thanks to Deniserows and <br>
Wendy in the East Bay, we had a terrific time, netted some great <br>
finds, and even used a bit of mental power along the way.  We will <br>
return soon to continue the fun.  If you haven't been there recently, <br>
we strongly recommend that you spend some time in Alameda.  Princess <br>
Lea started the boxing boom with her Year Of... series.  Lisascenic <br>
and other locals contributed, and now these two terrific ladies have <br>
made it a local mecca.  Hope you all enjoy it as much as we have!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too am thrilled to see all the new boxes being planted in my home town!  I don't even <br>
need to leave the island any more to increase my F count.  But I do wish to beg for mercy <br>
from Denise and Wendy - I can barely keep up!<br>
<br>
In the spirit of things, and since more people will be drawn to Alameda due to the efforts <br>
of these folks, I am dusting off and sprucing up my existing boxes in the area.  I replanted <br>
the missing Crustacean Inlet box yesterday (updated clues to be posted soon!) and <br>
checked on the one that was still there.  I had received a report that it had been the victim <br>
of the Stamp Switcher, but when I checked on the box, the original stamp was intact and <br>
inside.  So either the Switcher got the message and replaced it, or the person who sent me <br>
a message about finding a Pooh and Piglet stamp instead found some other box.  I also <br>
have the newest Lunar New Year stamp ready (Year of the Rat - it was a challenge to make <br>
something cute!) and will be reviving Rooster and Ram.  And Sushi House is ready to roll <br>
out again too.  And here's a tip for you LbNCA listers only - I have a mystery box on the <br>
island too - and it has not been visited much.  <br>
