box:<br/>
<br/>
1. Have you accomplished your sealed goal stored in your envelope? If <br/>
so, Wow! and Congratulations! <br/>
Let me know so I can open your envelope and send your written sheet <br/>
back to you. <br/>
The book is supposed to shift from sealed to opened envelopes over <br/>
time. Be among the first with an opened envelope!<br/>
<br/>
2. Has your contact information changed? (E-mail or postal address). <br/>
If so, let me know ASAP, so I can update your Tabula Rasa info. Thanks!<br/>
My e-mail &amp; postal address haven't changed.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you haven't achieved your goals, you may be making some <br/>
progress towards them or getting prepared.<br/>

<br/>
If you're interested in participating in the Tabula Rasa letterbox, <br/>
let me know by e-mail, and I'll set up a time for the Tabula Rasa book <br/>

Give me your availability to meet: which weekdays, weekends, days, or <br/>
