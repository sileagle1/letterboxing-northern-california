We zipped back to the South Bay this morning and returned Peter <br/>
Peter's stamp where it belongs.  Sorry again about the mixup.<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to locate Go Spartans.  Don't think we were in the <br/>
wrong location, but we'll be happy to learn if someone else finds it <br/>
after we didn't.<br/>
<br/>
Saxon's Nemesis is alive and well, and continues to tantalize and <br/>
tease dogs the world over.<br/>
<br/>
Found all three of the Rancho San Antonio Boxes.  Poison Oak is <br/>
thriving in the park, so be careful when you go searching.  Box #3, <br/>
Vulcan Greeting was visible, wet, and open.  We cleaned, dried, and <br/>
rehid carefully.  There was an additional stamp in the bag, not the <br/>
box.  It is a store-bought stamp that has shooting stars as its <br/>
image.  There was no logbook nor indication that it is supposed to be <br/>
a hitchhiker.  Does it sound familiar to any of you who have visited <br/>
the Vulcan Greeting box?  It had not been stamped into the logbook, so <br/>
we're wondering if one of you dropped it by accident.  <br/>

- the planter just decided to put 2 stamps in the box because they <br/>
liked them both.  Thanks for tending to the exposed box!  So sorry we <br/>
will not see you in Sacto.<br/>
