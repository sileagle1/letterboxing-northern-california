K-Martha was originally a hitchhiker, I believe, but now seems to make<br/>
its rounds as a traveling event stamp. The Cheese Racing and LbNA<br/>
boxes were always traveling events stamps.<br/>
<br/>
There's no support for traveling events stamps on AQ, so you don't<br/>
have to worry about logging them as finds. ;o)  Those boxes are just<br/>
for fun--they don't really count for anything.<br/>
