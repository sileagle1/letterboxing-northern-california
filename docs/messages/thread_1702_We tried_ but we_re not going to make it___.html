Recreation Program's fundraiser.  <br>
<br>
The sad fact is that we aren't going to make our personal fundraising<br>
goal, and the entire event only got to 60% of its total goal.<br>
<br>
Think of us on Saturday.  We'll be riding twenty five miles through<br>
the wine country near Geyserville.<br>
<br>
And if you happen to have twenty bucks burning a hole in your pocket,<br>
well, it would be great to have a little more support!<br>

And for those who don't have any idea about what I'm talking about,<br>
