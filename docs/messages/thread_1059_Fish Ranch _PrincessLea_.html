And in  other fast-moving news, Princess Lea has stayed true to her <br>
astonishing  track record, and found Fish Ranch within 48 hours of this <br>
box's  placement.  Way to go Lea!<br>

Wow, whoopie. . . OK, you beat us, Lea. That's what happens when you  finally <br>
have some free time after studying for your RN  forever!! I guess  you <br>
deserve this First Finder but, gee, we were sure we were going to be first  on this <br>
one . . .  <br>

I am actually not all that into the first finders race, but when <br>
there's a Lisa stamp involved, it's hard to keep me away for long.  I <br>
am trying to figure out when I can get over to Lodi for her cranes and <br>
also the other cool boxes that have popped up over there while I've <br>
been in school.<br>
