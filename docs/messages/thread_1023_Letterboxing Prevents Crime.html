                    <div class="plaintext-content">One morning around christmas, I went out to my car to head off to work &<br>
found stuff strewn all over the inside.  We don't live in the best of<br>
neighborhoods, so I must have left my car unlocked the night before and<br>
someone went through it looking for stuff to steal.  So, I started doing<br>
an inventory of all the standard stuff: CDs - still there, stereo<br>
faceplate - still there, cell phone charger - still there, change in the<br>
plain view in the cup holder - still there.  I was amazed they hadn't<br>
taken a single thing.  Then I started looking at what was thrown all<br>
over my car.  It was the contents of my letterboxing bag, my boxes of<br>
ink pads, bag with markers, compass, gloves, etc.  & that was all there<br>
too.  The only thing I could come up with is that someone was checking<br>
cars, found mine open, grabbed the most promising thing (my bag) &<br>
started rifling through it, & then was interrupted before they went any<br>
further.  If my bag hadn't been in my car, they probably would have had<br>
the time to grab all the aforementioned standard stuff & make off with<br>
it.  So, my letterboxing hobby prevented my stuff from being stolen.<br>
Now if I can only train my letterboxing bag to lock my car, I'd be set.<br>
