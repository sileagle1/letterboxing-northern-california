While not in Yuba City, we have one at Oroville Dam a few miles <br>
North. "Dam Raccoon" should still be WC accessable. I say should be as <br>
if you read the clues it was recarved by me, but replanted by another <br>
Letterboxer. The paths/trails were pretty substantial as I recall.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Sutter Buttes letterbox is pretty close by and is easily<br>
accessible.  When we went, there was a restaurant on Hwy 20 in Yuba<br>
City called Fresh Tomatoes. They had paper tableclothes that you could<br>
draw on with provided crayons. I think the staff was a little<br>
surprised when three adults left and the table was completely covered.<br>
I think you would like that place.<br>
<br>
Depending on how long your trip will be, there are a good deal of<br>
boxes around Grass Valley/Nevada City (you can get there via Hwy 20,<br>
it is a nice drive).  Of course, this would depend on snow fall, etc.<br>

<br>
<br>
The Sutter Buttes box was our first plant in 2003. Mrs Jiggs did <br>
maint in Jun when she was back in YC. The box is easily accessible <br>
and worth the detour off Rte 20 into Sutter.<br>
<br>
The parable series by the Salis Clan has been listed as Abandoned. I <br>
think at least 2 of these boxes may still be in place.<br>
<br>
A Duck in the Park is another easy find, though I'm unsure of its <br>
status.<br>
<br>
There are several new boxes placed within the last month or so in the <br>
YC/Marysville area. <br>
<br>
Rte 20 leading towards Grass Valley/Nevada City has the Bridgeport <br>
and Rough and Ready Boxes close by. There are others as well in and <br>
near these towns.<br>
<br>
South of YC on Rte 70, there are boxes in and near Wheatland, Lincoln <br>
and Roseville.<br>
<br>
I have a replacement Bok Kai box ready to be planted in Marysville, <br>
and the Colusa Conundrum ready to be placed in, well...Colusa very <br>
soon as well.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.cities <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In Nevada City there is a nice box call "Independence Trail" by<br>
Foothill Forester.  The Independence Trail is the first wilderness<br>
trail in the country with wheelchair accessibility.<br>
<br>
I placed a box 20 mi east of Nevada City just off Hwy 20 called<br>
"Emerald Pool".  It was a beautiful spot though that was in the summer<br>
 - not sure what the conditions are like in the winter.<br>
