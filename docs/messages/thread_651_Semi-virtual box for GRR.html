                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've got an idea for a great site to have a letterbox for the Gold Rush<br>
Romp.  Unfortunately, it's relatively tightly controlled & I'm worried<br>
about the box disappearing before the end of the day.  OTOH, due to the<br>
uniqueness of the location, the hunting process will be quite intriguing<br>
& different.  So, I'm thinking about making it like a physical virtual<br>
box.  You follow the clues through the site & the last clue gets you a<br>
piece of info that you give to me at the event.  Then you get to stamp<br>
in the box that I'm carrying with me.  <br>
 <br>
My concern is for those that solve the clues, but might have to leave<br>
early or don't see me again at the GRR.  How should I handle the box for<br>
those people?  I could send the person a sticker with the stamp on it<br>
for their book & they could send me one with their personal stamp for<br>
the box's book.  Or I could send them the whole box, but that would get<br>
expensive.  Now that I describe it, I guess it sounds a lot like<br>
Mimulus' Print the Legend box.  <br>
 <br>
Mimulus, what are you planning for your box after the GRR?<br>
 <br>
Thanks for any thoughts,<br>
