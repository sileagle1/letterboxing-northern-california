Well it has been over 6 weeks since we have gone Letterboxing or <br/>
Geocahing and I am getting antsy.  Soooooooo I decided to take a <br/>
little trip to Auburn for the Lemony Snicket.  But....... I can't <br/>
figure out any of this.  First off where in the world is the darn web <br/>
page?  Is it in Atlas Quest or Letterboxing .Org?  I have looked in <br/>
the ORg and found nothing at all.  I have tried every combo including <br/>
looking for the Lemony Snicket as the placer.  I did find one on <br/>
Atlas however there is 1 clue and I really don't see where there is <br/>
clue?   I went back and read the post on going to the clues ,clues, <br/>
clues.  I did that and it is all the same thing as what I already <br/>
have which is nothing.      Can or will someone give me a little bit <br/>
of help?  E-mail me offline please asap.  I would like to attempt <br/>
this hopefully this Sunday. Traffic permitting....thanks  Happy New <br/>
Year. M<br/>

<br/>
The link on the Clues Clues Clues! page is just to the box details. <br/>
You had to click on the clue link (it says "Click here for clue") to<br/>
get the actual clue, which is at<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?boxId=314<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  =)<br/>

Hi M,<br/>
<br/>
I have found this box with the help of the letterboxGoddess. I would<br/>
recommend reading the book "The Wide Window". Also some googling will<br/>
help. Just a note the box is worth the work.<br/>
