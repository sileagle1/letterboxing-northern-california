anyone wants to get together for a BBQ at our trailer or munchies out <br/>

Looks like we might have a few BBQ guests for 7/9. See post #1790 on <br/>
June 13th for the location of the RV park. I don't have any idea of <br/>
the park rules so we may either have the BBQ at our trailer or <br/>
community area if they have one. We have a 23ft Tahoe and a White <br/>
Chevy PU with shell, lic# Raftrig. If you would please leave your <br/>
dogs at home as we have a female Brittany that thinks she is a <br/>
pitbull, at least in her head not in her follow through. <br/>
We aren't set up to do much other than providing a BBQ so you should <br/>
bring your own utensils and picnic dinner with choice of meat to <br/>
cook. We will provide the icecream and paper plates. Think about <br/>
arriving 4:30 or 5pm and that should get us some stamping time and <br/>
cruising through logbooks.<br/>
Bring your own chairs too.<br/>
