to put it in a waterproof box and replace the paperwork and add a new <br/>
journal<br/>
(same old stamp) it will be back early next week.<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering what people do with the full logs from letterboxes, do <br/>
you leave them in the box or do you take them home...<br/>
<br/>
It sure was nice to see the stamps of everybody who visited my box! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
My other question is besides letterboxing.org is there a list of other <br/>
placees that list letterboxes and clues?<br/>

<br/>
If I replace the logbook, I take it with me to lose under piles of<br/>
papers and books somewhere.  =)  If someone else replaces a logbook<br/>
for me (usually because I'm not around to do it myself), I let them<br/>
keep the logbook for themselves as thanks for taking care of the box.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a collector of logbooks, but I don't leave old ones in the<br/>
wild either.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

Have you tried Atlasquest.com? Or <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/ Beware though that all the box listed in the latter site are not <br/>
necessarily still there.<br/>

We have done both. One of our LB State letterboxes has 3 log books <br/>
in the box, and is pretty tightly crammed. Generally we have pulled <br/>
others.<br/>
