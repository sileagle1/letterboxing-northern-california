And twice??? Did you do those hills twice? <br>
<br>
Yes Kel, we did them twice!!  Since it was so easy coming down through<br>
Planet Walk (even in the dark)compared to going up Gray Pine the first<br>
time, we had no clue as to how tough it would be to go up Planet Walk,<br>
just to get Pluto, until we did it the second time. It was not quite<br>
as steep, but still very taxing and probably a lot of this was due to<br>
the flareup I was having at the time.  I just don't like having a<br>
series unfinished.  We are going back to stamp in at Sideways #5, but<br>
not real soon.<br>
<br>
Now you see what I mean about Rattlesnake bar seeming like a "piece of<br>
cake".  Actually, it was such a nice pleasant walk that ended with a<br>
beautiful stamp that it actually did seem like desert.<br>
<br>
Maybe we're ready for Ryan's Montana de Oro loop 1 and loop 2.  Then<br>
again, maybe not.<br>
