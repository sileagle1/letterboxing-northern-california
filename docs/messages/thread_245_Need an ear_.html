  LOL...I know exactly what you're talking about.  My husband makes <br>
  fun of me because all I think about is letterboxing.  We'll be <br>
  driving down the road, or taking a walk and I'll blurt out "That <br>

  When you start finding letterboxes without clues then you know you are totally absorbed. <br>
<br>
  Last year when we went to Idaho Falls and met Cadenza, Gwen & I were walking around the area near the falls. We sat on a bench, and without saying anything to each other, casually reached under the side of the bench looking for hiding spots. I pulled out one of Cadenza's newly planted, no clues posted letterbox. We stamped in and later that evening when we met up with Cadenza showed her our book and explained that really seasoned letterboxers don't need clues.<br>

I guess we're seasoned, too--while looking for a certain famous <br>
waterfall letterbox in Oregon in May 03, we found a totally <br>
different letterbox that had no clues--wasn't listed anywhere.  We <br>
contacted the placers (who reside in FL) and they said while <br>
visiting Oregon on their 'annual' vacation, they looked for the <br>
famous box, couldn't find it, gave up, and hurriedly hid the box <br>
they planned to hide in the region.  They drafted clues to it and <br>
returned home to FL.  Then, somewhere along the way they misplaced <br>
the clues and had no idea how to 'clue' the box until they returned <br>
back to Oregon the following year.  Eventually we found it and were <br>
able to give them clues to it based on the true location of the <br>
original box they were seeking.  Turns out, their box was hidden <br>
about 3' from the original!!!  Wild!<br>
