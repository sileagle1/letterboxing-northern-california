Is there a return addy?  I would send  a message back telling him what a brat he is and that he abvoiusly hasn't grown up yet! The nerve of this guy.  If only his mother knew.    I am sorry to hear about this, it makes us all  stop and took a look at the wonderful way we teach our children.  I sure am glad that my boys have enough sense and have learned to keep their hands off things that do not belong to them.  God will punish him somehow someday..... grumpygrinchy <ffuselier@comcast.net> wrote:<br>

Certainly! The full moon is next Wednesday the 27th (8:07 pm). Make a replica <br>
of a  *&%$#@  kid out of a sock or something, concentrate on his dastardly <br>
act and stick a pin in it! (In the elbow or the foot or something, we don't want <br>
