discussing the idea of creating a California letterboxing patch, so I <br/>
wanted to let you all know and encourage you to participate as well.  I <br/>
think we're going to go about this much in the same way that they did <br/>
on the Newboxers list.  Anyone who wants to can submit a patch design, <br/>
and then we'll have a poll to vote on which one we want-- the Pepes <br/>
have graciously offered to host it on their blog.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be back with more details when I have them.  Comments/questions?<br/>
