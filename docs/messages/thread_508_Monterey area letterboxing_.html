<br/>
We're heading out to Monterey from Oakland to do some whale watching on a<br/>
boat, visit the aquarium, and hopefully - hike and letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
We only have two days for the whole thing, so we're hoping some of you might<br/>
help guide us toward letterboxes that fit these criteria (we'd like 2-3<br/>
trips, depending on their lengths):<br/>
<br/>
1. The hike is no longer than 3 miles (we can do more, but won't have time<br/>
for it)<br/>
<br/>
2. There are at least 2-3 boxes in the hike<br/>
<br/>
3. It's beautiful (in your eyes, at least)<br/>
<br/>
4. Perhaps it's even between Oakland and Monterey so we have reason to stop<br/>
on the way?<br/>
<br/>
5. The clues are easy enough that we can be sure of success (this is for our<br/>
6 year old :-))<br/>
<br/>
6. We'd also love to find some drive-by letterboxes potentially.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

I pulled the LBNA link to this box for a variety of reasons but as <br/>
far I know, it's still alive &amp; well.  I believe there's another, if <br/>
not a couple, boxes in this same area.  It's one of the most <br/>
beautiful spots on Earth!!!<br/>

Princess Lea's Monterey letterbox is great (contact me offline if you want an additional time-saving clue--good for when kids are along). Carmel Mission is easy, but the mission has hours and admission--you could probably find this info on the web. Have a fun trip.<br/>

We're just BACK from Monterey tonight, and as things turned out, we got<br/>
tired of being rained on in the morning while whale watching on a boat<br/>
(which was wonderful - particularly the HUNDREDS of dolphins who swam around<br/>
our boat - that was awesome). So even though we were standing and watching<br/>
the location of the Monterey letterbox, we did not have the energy to go<br/>
even that far, let alone to visit all the other places we had planned on for<br/>
the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
So, next time. We're planning to go on another whale boating trip in the<br/>
summer or fall to see the Blue whales.<br/>
<br/>
So strange to be within walking distance and not go get one!<br/>

I'm hoping to get down there one of these days and anytime I can get a <br/>

Hi everyone! I'm Kat from Moab,Utah and decided to check out the <br/>
N.Cal group and see what everyone is up to out in California. I used <br/>
to live in Carmel until a couple of years ago when we decided to <br/>
move to a different kind of paradise.<br/>
<br/>
Honour Bugz, do you live near the peninsula? I have started leaving <br/>
boxes there when I come over every couple of months and would love <br/>
it if there was someone close by to check on them. My box, "A Good <br/>
Dog's Life" has been a pain lately, because the State Beach rangers <br/>
have taken it and passed it around the district, none of them <br/>
knowing what to do with a letterbox. I talked to her on Friday, and <br/>
the boxes (I placed a first one, it disappeared, I replaced it, it <br/>
disappeared) were in her office as of Friday. Did you find it this <br/>
last weekend? She was saying she might put it back where she found <br/>
it, but it would be better if I would come pick it up from her. So <br/>
I'm confused about where they are!!!! (Gee, let me just run by her <br/>
office from Utah real quick)<br/>
<br/>
I'll be leaving another box out there in a couple of weeks, but <br/>
definitely not near Asilomar State Beach!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I decided to say Hi and not just lurk in the background! I <br/>
recognize lots of trail names here from some great boxes I have <br/>
found on my drives to and from California. Thanks everyone for <br/>
making a 15 hour drive even longer but much more fun! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Kat (Did you find the third box at Jack's Peak? We looked everywhere <br/>
and couldn't find it)<br/>
