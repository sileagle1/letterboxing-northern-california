I also was able to pick up the Neighborhood school box in Dixon.  Easy<br>
20 minute detour for anyone going through Dixon during they day.  The<br>
box planter (the school principal I think) was very nice & glad to meet<br>
another boxer.  I was only the 2nd person to get the stamp & I think<br>
it's been around since October.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm probably 10 minutes from this box and NEVER remember to go get it during <br>
the week--only on weekends when it's not available. Thanks for the reminder--I <br>
think I have time tomorrow!<br>
