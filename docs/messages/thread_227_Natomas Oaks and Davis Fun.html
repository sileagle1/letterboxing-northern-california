Microbox.  We finally located it and happily stamped our logbook.  <br>
The paper strip in the Natomas canister is now FULL!<br>
<br>
We had such fun discovering 7 of Davis's letterboxes.  We started <br>
with Cupid's Arrow, then found The Best of Davis 1, 2, 3, and 5.  <br>
Either we turned over many wrong rocks at #4, or it has gone <br>
missing.  We enjoyed the Rocky Trail and were very pleased to find <br>
its box - yes it does exist, Jiggs.  We finished our day with Ryan's <br>
clever box at UC Davis.<br>
<br>
We feel that we got a great look at some of Davis's best offerings <br>
while we walked and searched.  Thanks to all who took time to <br>
prepare and place their boxes.<br>

go there so we can find the boxes too!! I've never seen a microbox, that would<br>
be neat to find one!<br>

but the owner of the box had removed it for maintenance and forgot to <br>
pass this info along, so we spent a bunch of time searching for the <br>
phantom box.<br>
<br>
Sadly, we won't be able to pick this one up anytime soon, as we're <br>
now firmly entrenched here in ON.<br>
