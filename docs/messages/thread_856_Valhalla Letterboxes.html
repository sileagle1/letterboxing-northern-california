ps It's funny, I would have thought the third location inappropriate, since it involved going off trail and perhaps blazing a new one. I will ask her.<br/>

&gt; Dear Kel Gennert,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello!  Thank you very much for your response to the Forest Service, Lake<br/>
&gt; Tahoe Basin Management Unit, regarding your letterboxes.  Thank you also<br/>
&gt; for posting the update on the website.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand you came to the Supervisor's Office to pick up the two<br/>
&gt; letterboxes we pulled.  I had wanted to meet with you, but unfortunately I<br/>
&gt; was at another site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You asked about the third letterbox at the Tallac Site.  We did leave the<br/>
&gt; third letterbox in place, as it is in a good location.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd still like to meet with you and talk about places to hide your<br/>
&gt; letterboxes at the Tallac site.  I'll be working out there most of next<br/>
&gt; week (August 15 to 19), so perhaps I can meet  you on site or I can meet<br/>
&gt; you at the Supervisor's Office.  You can reach me at the office at (530)<br/>
&gt; 543-2673 or on my cell at (530) 545-2538.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
