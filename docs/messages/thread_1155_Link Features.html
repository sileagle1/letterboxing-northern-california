It had been awhile since I last updated those messages, and it was<br>
actually the photos that prompted me to update them. =) When I<br>
originally created it, Yahoo Groups didn't support the option of a<br>
photo so I hard-coded it into the message itself. Now that Yahoo<br>
*does* support one photo there, I took the hard-coded message out.<br>
<br>
Then I got to thinking about if the message itself should be updated.<br>
They used to link to the main talk list, but I figured most people<br>
were likely to find the regional talks FROM the main talk list, so<br>
that was probably just wasted space.<br>
<br>
Then I got to thinking about what could I include that might be useful<br>
for people? Links to the major cities in the covered area, of course!<br>
 Thought I was so clever. =) Read the lists and with a single click,<br>
poof! Lots of boxes!<br>
<br>
Wish I could have added more cities, but alas, Yahoo only allows a<br>
maximum of 2,000 characters for the message and I ran out of room.<br>
<br>
I had considered updating the message on the LbNE group since I'm the<br>
owner there too, but I don't even visit that board anymore and gave up<br>
control of it to locals who would follow it more closely than I would<br>
years ago. Didn't seem right for me to meddle with their board<br>
anymore, even if I am still technically the owner. I also thought<br>
about updating the Southern California board since I am a moderator on<br>
that board, but it really seems like only the owners should update it,<br>
so I decided not to.<br>
<br>
But I like it. *nodding* Click your way to happiness. =)<br>

Well, truth be told, I do have a certain affinity for Atlas Quest.<br>
Definitely can't claim I'm unbiased on that count. ;o)<br>
