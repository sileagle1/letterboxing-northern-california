<br/>
  We went up there last weekend to check things out:  it was VERY dry, so bring lots of water, and with the weather changing, I'd suggest dressing in layers.<br/>
<br/>
  There is a dog park, but dogs are not allowed in the WHOLE park.  The terrain over the whole park is pretty rough.  There's a covered picnic area (subject to reservation) near the old homestead, with trees and a nice grassy area where it'd be nice for lunch.  <br/>
<br/>
  Can't wait for this weekend!<br/>
