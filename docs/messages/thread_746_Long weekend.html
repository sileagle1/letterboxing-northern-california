Wasnt able to letterbox due to such a busy sched. but did check on my <br/>
very first P...unfortunately it had been caught up in the recent <br/>
flooding there. I found the box-empty, the notebook-floating in a <br/>
small pond, and no stamp. Oh well, will have to replant next year. <br/>
Glad to hear some of my boxes are still alive and well though. Hope to <br/>
get a bunch tomorrow or Friday as I have the day off w/out any kids to <br/>
tow around. <br/>
