Hi Folks,<br/>
Gwen &amp; I just finished a short cruise through the Auburn, Placerville <br/>
areas. Found some, but made sure we left 3 in our wake(see What's <br/>
New). Mooney's Grove, Kaweah Post Office, Khanda,Say Cheese Pleease, <br/>
Alien Smorgasbord,Jumper's Reward, Bucky's Feathered Friend, <br/>
Fairoaks,North Fork Diggin's , #1 I 80 series, Furry O, Folsom Prison, <br/>
Best of Davis #5, The Hidden Turtle, Cupid's Arrow, Bounce- Bounce, <br/>
Posey, Blushing Butterfly, Kerr Park, Valley Oak Recreation Park,are <br/>
all alive and well and Orange Blossom Special needed some help with a <br/>
temporary stamp due to some geocachers. Thanks for all of the plants <br/>
and for those that are going to the GRR, you might be able to hit our <br/>
three when in route. The Knight Flyers has the best location <br/>
particularly if you like covered bridges.We picked up three HHers and <br/>
had a great lunch exchange with Double Saj. Wish we could make the <br/>
GRR, but we just can't. There is going to be an LA gathering on May 22.<br/>
<br/>
