Hey all!   If you are planning on attending the event, here are a <br/>
few reminders...<br/>
<br/>
It should run from 1-5, the first hour probably being a bit of meet <br/>
and greet (I don't know any of you!), some people are bringing <br/>
snacks or drinks (if you've asked me about it already, I'm thinking <br/>
you are going to do it)  I'll have paper plates and cups.<br/>
<br/>
You probably want to bring design images or other ideas, books, <br/>
sketches, burning questions...it would be good to bring a piece <br/>
of your favorite carving medium as well.  I'll have some <br/>
Safe-T-Cut for folks to play with.  And I've got carving tools, but <br/>
feel free to bring your own.  I've also got plenty of paper and <br/>
pencils for your sketches.<br/>
<br/>
We'll see you then!  And please remember NOT to park on the <br/>
side of the street across from the school, use the small lot in <br/>
front  or park on the SCHOOL side of the street. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
