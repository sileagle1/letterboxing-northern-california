successful (much to my astonishment, to tell you the truth), I've <br>
decided to expand my domain--err, I mean expand the idea to <br>
California where I have a lot of history and letterboxes.  =)<br>
<br>
A couple of note about the talk list settings....<br>
<br>
The 'Links' section I've set up so only moderators can change them<br>
(which, at this point, only inclues myself). If you want to add,<br>
change, or delete a link, e-mail me and I'll get right on it.  I want<br>
it to be a useful, organized place that people can visit to find<br>
information about letterboxing in general as well as links geared<br>
towards California. They don't even have to be letterboxing links per <br>
se, but rather anything a Californian letterboxer might find useful <br>
from orienteering events to hiking trails.  (I've always wanted to do <br>
an orienteering event.  Just do that someday....)<br>
<br>
My first task for the talk list is to set up a bunch of links linking <br>
to the personal websites of all California letterboxes.  So if you <br>
have a letterboxing website you want to promote, send me the URL and <br>
I'll get it added ASAP.<br>
<br>
I've removed a couple of miscellaneous options like the chat and<br>
database features because, well, I've never heard of anyone actually<br>
using them. If you REALLY want to chat with someone, you can always<br>
go to the main letterboxing board to do that, I suppose. If for some<br>
reason you actually do find a really useful purpose for those<br>
features, let me know and I'll put them back.<br>
<br>
Over the next couple of weeks I'll probably be playing with the<br>
colors before I settle down on a final color scheme.  It'll help <br>
remind you which talk list you're actually dealing with after getting <br>
halfway through typing in that 20 page message. In the meantime, <br>
expect bizarre colors to show up suddenly and unexpectedly for brief <br>
periods of time. =)  I think I'm going to go with lots of yellow hues <br>
since so much of California does look yellow (at least in the <br>
summertime!) and it'll be a clear contrast from the main talk list <br>
and the Pacific Northwest talk list which I am also the owner of.<br>
<br>
Okay, that's the last of my long, legalise-kindof-speak. Take off<br>
your shoes and make yourselves at home. =)<br>

Carpe diem!<br>
