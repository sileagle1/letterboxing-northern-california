                    <div class="plaintext-content">We checked this morning on our two letterboxes near Knights Ferry.  <br/>
<br/>
Spring Thing is now retired:  The Stanislaus River has washed away the <br/>
surrounding landmarks and left our Spring Thing up a tree in the <br/>
river.  We do not anticipate it becoming available any time in the <br/>
near future, and do not recommend that you try to locate it.  We <br/>
believe your safety is more important than this letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Beauteous Bud survived the winter floods, but just barely.  We found <br/>
it in place but it had been totally submerged for quite some time, <br/>
soaking the logbook.  We cleaned the stamp, added a fresh logbook and <br/>
stronger container, and placed it nearby in a dry location.  We <br/>
updated the clues to reflect the new site.<br/>
<br/>
We also checked on another box nearby placed by one of our renowned <br/>
California letterboxing couples.  It is dry, well, and awaiting your <br/>
visit.<br/>
