Dear fellow LBers,<br/>
<br/>
Just want everyone to know what a great letterbox you're missing.<br/>
Today we went in search of BUCKHORN planted by Funhog.<br/>
The stamp is exceptional and wait until you see the book cover!!<br/>
The trail is very nice, as well..  We even did it in the dark, although <br/>
I wouldn't<br/>
recommend doing it.  Besides, you want to go so you can see the sights.  <br/>
Just<br/>
before sunset would be ideal.  I was constantly in fear of snakes, since<br/>
I couldn't see where we were going. We only had a pin light flash light <br/>
and there<br/>
were no trail maps in the holder for us to take along.  So, as you're <br/>
walking the trail,<br/>
think of us doing it in the dark.  You  may not want to take the trail <br/>
it after a heavy rain,<br/>
so get to it now!!!  It was last found by JIGGS exactly 11 months ago.<br/>

Fellow Letterboxers,<br/>
<br/>
On the funny side, I forgot to mention last night, that my husband's<br/>
response to me complaining about the possibility of snakes was:<br/>
"snakes are very timid creatures, and they're more scared of<br/>
me, than I am of them."  Yeah, right!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, there wasn't even a sliver of a moon to help us walk out<br/>
of there!<br/>

Hey All!<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick note from the northern climes<br/>
<br/>
We were interested to note that someone had finally managed to get <br/>
out to Funhog's Buckhorn box after we visted last November! <br/>
<br/>
Wow, Doublesaj and Old Blue, looks like we REALLY beat you ro this <br/>
one lol!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this finds you and the rest of the LbNCA community doing well <br/>
and padding those PFX totals. We're making slow but steady progress <br/>
here. Interesting to note that as of today, we have a whopping 66 <br/>
boxes in the province (not bad when you consider there were only 5 <br/>
when we first found out we were moving in May)!<br/>
<br/>
Take care<br/>
<br/>
Pete aka Jiggs<br/>
