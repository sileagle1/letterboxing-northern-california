                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've had a stamp carved and the box ready to plant for a while but <br>
no time to get out to place it.  This past Sunday, we decided to put <br>
it on our "must do" list.<br>
<br>
We ran into two problems.  First problem:  it was dark (imagine <br>
that!)but we knew exactly where we were going to place the box so <br>
didn't think this would be a problem.  Secondly:  The tree we were <br>
going to use had been removed along with all of the others near it.<br>
  <br>
Now, we had to find another hiding place.   We looked in possible <br>
bushes and under rocks, but this was a well maintained landscaped <br>
urban area and nothing seemed permanent enough.  We walked up and <br>
down and all around the area several times before settling on a <br>
spot.  We came home feeling pretty good about where the box was <br>
placed.  In fact, it was in a better spot then the original one <br>
would have been.  <br>
<br>
By the time we came in to post the clue, we had an e-mail from <br>
someone saying he/she/they was/were the first finder of our box and <br>
wanted to know where to find the clue.  What a surprise!  How did <br>
this happen?  The only thing we could think of was that someone had <br>
been sitting in a darkened car and watched us roaming around; our <br>
movements had piqued their curiousity and they went to investigate <br>
after we left.<br>
<br>
We responded to the e-mail and had to wait until the next day for a <br>
reply.  Turns out that this was a geocacher.  There seems to be <br>
quite a few, possibly 25 or more, caches within a mile or so <br>
around this box.  The geocacher suggested that we leave it where it <br>
was and make it a hybrid.  We didn't want to do this, so we had to <br>
go back out last night and rehide the box.  It is still in the area <br>
of all of the geocaches but we have placed very noticeable warnings <br>
on the box. All we can do now is cross our fingers and hope that <br>
other geocachers that stumble upon this box are as knowledgeable of <br>
letterboxing and as respectful of our box as the first one was. <br>
<br>
This is not the first time that something like this has happened to <br>
us, but the other box completely disappeared before we could get <br>
back home and post the clue.<br>
<br>
Now that we've gotten your attention and you're wanting to see what <br>
all of the hoopla is about, we hope to have the clue up by this <br>
evening. <br>
