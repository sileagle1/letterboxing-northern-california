&gt; Yeah, yeah, laugh all you want. Phonetically, Sagittarius (which is<br/>
&gt; what the "saj" depicts) IS "SAJ" and it looks a lot better than "SAG"<br/>
&gt; which is correct for the spelling. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know, and I know that's probably why you changed it to saj,<br/>
and I'm sure that's why Sierra Sally accidently put sag.  I just never<br/>
saw it that way, and it struck a funny bone of mine!  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hey, I'm 50 and am entitled to a little sagging these days anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Boy, if I was twice my age, Old Blue would have something to worry<br/>
about. I didn't notice a single sag!  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Okay....  another topic....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; is it okay to scan and post the microbox visitor logs on our <br/>
&gt; website?<br/>
<br/>
I'd definitely have to urge you *not* to do this.  There are some<br/>
people who'd rather not have their stamp image online, and unless you<br/>
get permission from the people that logged in, I wouldn't recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxing.org FAQ even has this to say: "Don't publish or<br/>
re-transmit other peoples' clues or stamp images without their<br/>
permission."<br/>
<br/>
However, if you put a disclaimer in your clues telling people that by<br/>
stamping into the box they are giving consent to have their entry<br/>
scanned in and displayed on your website, I don't think it would be an<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
If you just want to provide a list of everyone who logged in--without<br/>
the scanned images, just a list of names and perhaps the date it was<br/>
found--I doubt anyone would be too upset with that either.<br/>
<br/>

In other news.....  Rumor has it that Lemony Snicket won't come out of<br/>
hiding if Bush wins the election.  Not sure if it's true or not, but I<br/>
can't say I blame him.  ;o)<br/>
