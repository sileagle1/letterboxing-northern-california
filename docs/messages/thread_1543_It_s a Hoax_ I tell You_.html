one called the American Dime Museum, which -- alas -- recently folded.<br/>

In Cooperstown, NY, there is the famous (if you follow this sort of<br/>
thing) Cardiff Giant, a supposed fossil of a gigantic proto-human. <br/>
He's very impressive, and you can (I think) see the sculptor's<br/>
chisel-marks.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I'm the sort of "geek" who goes to lectures on the origins of<br/>
the American Museum, and reads about the Feejee Mermaid!<br/>

When I was about 11 or 12 years old, my friends &amp; I would buy copies <br/>
of The Enquirer, which back then, was much more like The Weekly World <br/>
News that you can find at checkout counters sometimes. We loved <br/>
reading about the Ape Babies from Sumatra, the Siamese Quintuplets, <br/>
and so on. <br/>
<br/>
The Weekly World News is possibly the sole source of current events <br/>
worth reading! [Grin} You can read about how Bigfoot is an advisor to <br/>
Bush on national security and how a woman in Utah is having Batboy's <br/>
baby. <br/>
<br/>
My curiosities are tame in comparison, and are just interesting <br/>
specimems of natural history. If you want a freak show, look to our <br/>
government officials...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the links, Lisa. As a boy, I always wanted to see the <br/>
Cardiff Giant, but we never got further than the parking lot of the <br/>
Farmer's Museum in Cooperstown.<br/>
