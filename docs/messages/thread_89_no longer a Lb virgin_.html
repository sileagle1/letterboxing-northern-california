                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI!  I am a newbie to the letterboxing world.  I heard about it when I<br/>
listened to NPR (national public radio) a week or so ago and I was so<br/>
excited to discover one of the hidden boxes that I immediately took<br/>
the dog out and went searching!  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the<br/>
box at the end of the clues (as I'm sure you've all experienced), but<br/>
I didn't give up!  My first box was found in Santa Clara (ironically<br/>
where I go to school) and lets just say I was ELATED when I finally<br/>
discovered it.  I am so happy to be a part of this tradition and I<br/>
can't wait to make my own stamp and eventually my own box for others<br/>
to find.<br/>
The problem is I have NO idea what to put on my stamp, and<br/>
unfortunately for my I'm an art enthusiest (and Major) so I'm being<br/>
way to much of a perfectionist about it.  I was wondering if any of<br/>
you had an idea of what to put on the stamp?!!  I hope all is well and<br/>
if any of you know of boxes in the Bay Area I would love to hear where<br/>
I can search for them!!! <br/>

If you're an art major, you could carve a stamp of a Picasso or <br/>
something.  *shrug*  Doesn't really matter, though.  If you start <br/>
using a stamp and decide later you don't like it, you can always <br/>
switch to a new one.  :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, I think your inspiration for a stamp may come from <br/>
your 'sign off' name itself--don't you live rather close to a very <br/>
famous 'bridge' or a few other famous 'wannabe' bridges?  You could <br/>
go that route with a very 'architectural detailed' bridge stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Or...you could go the more natural route and carve a stamp of <br/>
the 'natural bridges' (or is it only one bridge these days down at <br/>
Natural Bridges SP? not sure when it would eventually become Natural <br/>
Bridge SP) that aren't terribly far from you down near Santa Cruz.  <br/>
Just brainstorming...<br/>

*laughing*  Shhh....  You can tell people that was the look you were <br/>
going for and everyone will be in awe.  It's all about marketing <br/>
your stamps, I tell you.  ;o)<br/>
