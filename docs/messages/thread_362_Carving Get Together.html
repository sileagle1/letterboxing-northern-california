most votes.  Sorry to those who won't be able to make it.  I realize <br/>
that it's a terrible time right before the holidays, but it will be <br/>
lots of fun to take a break from that madness at the malls.  We will <br/>
schedule the event from 1:00 to 5:00 at Blackbird's School, which if I <br/>
am thinking of the right place is right off Highway 13 at Redwood Road <br/>
(Blackbird, please provide directions and what building we should go <br/>
to).<br/>
<br/>
I am open to suggestions about what emphasis you'd like me to take with <br/>
the demo.  I will most likely do a basic description of the various <br/>
carving materials and tools, as well as some carving tips.  Maybe some <br/>
folks can offer hints on designing, or where they get their ideas from? <br/>
  Anyway, send me an email if you have an idea for a topic.  Thanks <br/>
everyone and see you next month<br/>
