I'm still here! I found 3 boxes yesterday and also made the Gilroy<br/>

<br/>
I haven't done much boxing since Moab in the spring...summer's<br/>
too busy. I did carve a groovy sig stamp for a new local boxer,<br/>
though. And I've been painting a little. yahoo!!<br/>
<br/>
I am signed up for the Live and Breathe (Oregon) gathering, but am not<br/>
sure I can make it. As they don't give refunds, if anyone thinks<br/>
they're going to register and pay, would you be interested in talking<br/>
to me first? I have two bunkhouse spots paid for, and can transfer<br/>
my reservation.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Kel<br/>

p.s. to Robb and Lisa--I hope you guys are better now. Sick is NO fun!<br/>
boxing=fun  sick=no fun<br/>
Lisa, did you get snail mail from me? (a while ago)<br/>
