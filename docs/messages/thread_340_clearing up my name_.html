Sorry everyone.  I guess I need to explain my name. I use Deiselluver <br/>
only becuase way before I was into LB I had signed up to Yahoo with <br/>
this name.  I cannot seem to find out how or if I can change it?  My <br/>
actuall name is Michelle and Hubbys name is Jeff we go by BOOTZOO-<br/>
CREW.  So if you see our stamp (we double stamp)  One is the carved <br/>
the stamp and the other says underneath it BootZOO- CREW) THat is <br/>
us!   I know it's confusing, does anyone know if I can change it?  Or <br/>
is it ok the way it is?  Thanks<br/>
<br/>
