Well it seems the LBNA site is hiccuping again, glad to see I am not <br/>
the only one having problems.  I thought it was me, but apparently <br/>
not. I hope to have the final 3 gray pine boxes posted soon.  For <br/>
those of you who print out clues when they are posted (This means <br/>
you Princess Lea) you will need to go a reprint them because they <br/>
have totally changed.  <br/>
<br/>
I had such nice feedback from people who enjoyed The Birds (Thank <br/>
you!, blush) that I revamped this series to be clues that involve <br/>
multiple choice from the movie "Sideways".  A very funny and <br/>
bittersweet film, playing now in theaters and on alot of top ten <br/>
movies of the year lists.  But since it  is not available on video, <br/>
I made them pretty easy.  I think this movie still has lots of good <br/>
trivia if anyone else would want to use it for the WIne COuntry <br/>
Challenge, its a natural for that topic.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to Old Sac gathering in April.  Is anyone out there <br/>
interested in also getting together sometime in February as well?<br/>
