That would be me. . .I'm a rabid quilter and  have scads of novelty fabric. <br/>
I'd just made a cute apron for a friend of mine  and knew a few pieces needed <br/>
to live in this box.<br/>

I think I shared some pictures of my quilting with y'all.  I'm a slow <br/>
quilter, but I keep at it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, when Robb comes home I'll have some time for that sort of <br/>
thing...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!  You really made me smile!<br/>
