area boxes.<br/>
I wish that I had had more time to get ALL of them.<br/>
<br/>
I got 4 out of the 6 Halloween Series in Pasadena. One was missing <br/>
and I didn't get the Charmed Witch because the City Hall area was <br/>
terribly crowded when I was there and I just never got back to it.<br/>
<br/>
I got all 7 of the Arroyo Seco Series. It was such a gorgeous day to <br/>
be outdoors in LA, and this was a wonderful walk. <br/>
<br/>
I also was able to stop by and pick up Biking in Lacy Park.  <br/>
<br/>
The other boxes will have to wait for another day.<br/>
