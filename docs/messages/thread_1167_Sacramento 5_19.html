Ann's have been erased.  I'm not sure of our plans on Friday, but I/we<br/>
might be able to meet you there &amp; I can walk you through the missing<br/>
clues &amp; do an exchange too.  I'll get back to you about dinner, but I<br/>
just wanted to warn you about the Fanny Ann's box not being active<br/>
(better update that on lb.org).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, as of a few weeks ago, both my Eureka box &amp;<br/>
artTrekker's box in the same place are still there, in spite of numerous<br/>
reports of their demise.  I have heard though that Da Kool Kats' boxes<br/>
that are behind the counters in Old Sac businesses have been "lost",<br/>
meaning employees didn't know anything about them when they were asked.<br/>
I'm pretty sure Da Kats haven't pulled them, just probably employee<br/>
turn-over.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on where the field trip is, you might be able to make it to<br/>
artTrekker's Sac Zoo box (www.saczoo.com).  Note the Aloha Box is<br/>
missing.  Other than that, the Old Sac boxes are probably the largest<br/>
concentration of easily accessable boxes in town (at least 3 that I know<br/>
of, not counting Fanny Ann's &amp; Da Kats' boxes in the businesses).  <br/>
