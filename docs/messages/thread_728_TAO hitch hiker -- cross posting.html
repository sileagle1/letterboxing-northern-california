Can anyone connect me with the creator of the TAO hitch hiker?  <br/>
We found it in Pleasant Hill, CA.  Unfortunately, the box it was <br/>
hitched to was sitting out in the open, and there was no log book <br/>
for TAO.  We would like permission to create another log book for <br/>
this stamp before we re-plant it.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, there was a note in the "host" letterbox that a person <br/>
in a such-and-such model car was looking to meet guys for a <br/>
little action.  Since almost all of the people who had stamped <br/>
into the book were kids, and since (presumably) the person who <br/>
left this note wasn't a letterboxer, we removed that page from the <br/>
log book.  It just seemed too creepy!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had to deal with that particular issue before?  <br/>

  Yep, and while some letterboxers go ballistic about messin with their letterboxes we usually try to use our best judgement and if there is some non letterboxing stuff in the log we remove it. We are in the appology mode after the fact, and will let the placer know what we have done. Did you look up the HH on Pete &amp; Wanda's pages?<br/>
