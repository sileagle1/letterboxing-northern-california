party to attend, and more champagne to consume, but I wanted to at<br/>
least share some ride photos with my Letterboxing friends.  Anything<br/>
that's along the road, was taken while I was riding, and since I have<br/>
a SLR camera (not a point and shoot) it is a bit of a miracle that I<br/>
didn't fall off my bike.<br/>
