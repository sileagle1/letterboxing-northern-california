few in Big Sur - in the parks - Homestead and Oak something... (I  don't have <br/>
time to look) if you put in Big Sur, you may come up with them, but  also try <br/>
"Carmel" or "Monterey" and you'll probably get a bunch. I did a few in  Big <br/>
Sur last December... LOTS OF FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/>

I'm not sure if SPCA's "Way Cool" is still there, but even if it is <br/>
missing the location is spectacular!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Amanda's "Big Sur Homestead" is a great hike, but be advised that <br/>
cougars have been seen in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Work on Mtnmans marathon clues before you go. <br/>
<br/>
When we were there before the lastest gas crunch we paid $3.75 per <br/>
gallon. Who knows what you could expect.<br/>

We boxed that area last Feb - Don's suggestion of Way Cool is so true!  That is an awesome box!  There is a hybrid box called Saddle Rock there - great locale  - but we didn't know if was a hybrid when we went - so it is a giant box!  Also in that park is Canyon  Owl and that is a fun little hike.<br/>
<br/>
In Big Sur itself we got The Lorax and Amanda's Homestead and Oak Grove.  We DID see a mountain lion on the trail coming back from Oak Grove.  Fortunately, we didn't appear very tasty!  <br/>
<br/>
The Big Sur Marathon is another great box that Don mentioned - do your homeowrk on that one before you go - I think both Don and Gwen and The Boxalots found that one with only half the clues - a lucky find for us!  Don't count on the folks in the area to be able to answer the questions.<br/>
<br/>
And all the Monterery and Carmel area boxes are great finds too!  Hope that helps - if you want to know more, email me!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Honour of The Boxalots<br/>

<br/>
I suggest that you leave enough time on the way down to Big Sur or on<br/>
the way back to stop in Monterey for the Wharf Cat Letterbox by Jay<br/>
Drew.  He lives in CT and is an avid boxer and placer.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have gotten all of the boxes on the Monterey Peninsula thus<br/>
far, but haven't been to any of the ones below Carmel.  Every stamp in<br/>
the Monterey area has been hand carved, save one and they are all<br/>
excellent.  I've heard that the Big Sur boxes are the same. <br/>
Excellent, that is! <br/>

Enjoy your trip.  It's beautiful down there.<br/>
