<br/>
One of our local letterbox families (the Boxalots) is from LA.  I know<br/>
they have been on vacation in LA for the month of August and is/was<br/>
due back the end of August.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what part of LA Honor is from, but no matter what town<br/>
it  is, as long as it is in LA, it can't be good news.  Honor lost her<br/>
father earlier this year and her mother is relatively alone.<br/>
<br/>
Boxalots or Gatorlovers let us know what's happening!<br/>
<br/>
My family in North Central MS is still without electricity due to bad<br/>
winds and lots of rain, no major flooding.  They're hoping to have it<br/>
restored by this evening or tomorrow at the latest.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone will say a prayer or at least send good thoughts and do<br/>
what you can monetarily.<br/>

northern LA, is fine, as is her brother and family. <br/>
<br/>
We were all worried when the hurricane might have gone north instead of <br/>
eastward, but prayers were answered!<br/>
<br/>
Honour's Mom is doing fine.  She is actually is putting up some <br/>
"refugees" in her home from the southern area.  She will keep herself <br/>
occupied with her businesses and her house guests.  We are all grateful.<br/>
<br/>
With school starting this week in our area, and Honour picking her life <br/>
back up, I'm sure you'll see her back on the lists soon! <br/>
<br/>
She came back on the 23rd and headed to SanFran on the 24th!!!  I know <br/>
she got some of Paul's new boxes!  She's jumping back in, and I'm sure <br/>
you'll hear from her soon!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure she'll agree with me when I say we thank you all for the <br/>
concern and support!!!  SMOOCHES to Carole!!<br/>

Thank you so much for the concern.  My family is all fine and in a part of Louisiana that was out of the path.  My brother informed me today that gas pumps were shut off in town and they are going to rationing in Shreveport.  He reports that refugees (just never imagined using that word in conjunction with Americans in our own country) are in every available space - and my Mom has opened her home long-term to some folks from New Orleans.  My only concern for my family at the moment is the fact that my Mom is traveling alone.  She is in Atlanta right now and needs to get back to northern Louisiana in the next few days.  She told me tonight that gas in Atlanta was at $4.95/gallon.  She waited in line for hours and has a full tank - but wouldn't get home on that.  And there is no gas in the majority of Mississippi.  So - she will probably enjoy the hotel there in Georgia for awhile longer.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am still in shock from the complete devastation.  If I remember correctly - the Grumpy Grinches have family in southern Louisiana....how are they?  My husband is so busy with the huge response from the military....the task is enormous.  I lurk on the LBLaMiss list - and we are still waiting to hear from some of the amazing boxers from the New Orleans area.<br/>
<br/>
We did a small bit of boxing when we were home for a month - re-planted and planted a new one in Louisiana - got a couple of TX boxes....but truly LOVED Paul's stamps that we jumped on the day after we returned!  We had a great boxing day in SF....hunted 7 and found 7!  And were thrilled that Playland does indeed LIVE!<br/>
<br/>
Carole - Thanks again for the concern - we are fine...it has just been a tough year.  And like Mim...we are always up for a gathering.  The road ralley idea courtesy of Double Saj and Old Blue did sound fun....there is an east coast event like that as well I think.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Honour of the Boxalots<br/>

Grumpy has a first cousin who lives (lived?) in Slidell.  Her family <br/>
is staying indefinitely in Alexandria, in north central LA.  Don't <br/>
suppose they will have a home to return to, but at least they are safe <br/>
and sheltered with other family.  Thanks for asking.<br/>
