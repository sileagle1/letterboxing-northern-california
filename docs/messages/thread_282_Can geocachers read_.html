Thanks to the heads up from Grumpy Grinch I found out a stamp was <br>
removed by a neophyte geocacher.  It turns out there is a geocache <br>
very nearby and a beginner confused my box with a geocache.  Despite <br>
it being clearly labeled "This is not a geocahce, please do not remove <br>
stamp" they signed the book, took the stamp and left a pikachu eraser. <br>
 <br>
 I label all my boxes, but it failed to help in this case.  Anyway, I <br>
emailed them (My partner is a member of geocache.com so I could easily <br>
contact them)  and hopefully a geocacher will get converted to <br>
letterboxing.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, it seems letterboxing is not prominently mentioned on their <br>
website...perhaps as an organiztion LBers can ask them to include <br>
mention of letterboxes, how to know the difference and how to respect <br>
them.<br>

I am a geocacher.. Sorry, However there is a refrence to Letterboxing on the Geocaching.com site.  That is how I got in to this.  I do however think it is very stupid on their part to take your stuff.  Geo boxes all usually have a flyer in them explaining do not remove or take property of.... These people shoildn't of removed you stamp either.  Can you get it back or did they place it in another Cache? I hope they have enough sense to get it back to you.  Keeping my fingers crossed.<br>
