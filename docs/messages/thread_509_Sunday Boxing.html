Hooray :)  Even better, both hunts we went on, the boxes were still alive.  It seems every time I take a non-letterboxer letterboxing to show them what it is, we come up empty :(<br/>
So, the Golden Gate Bridge and Hawk Hill boxes are still there!  Someone had just stamped into the Hawk Hill box some time earlier in the day.  We must have just missed an exchange.<br/>
I also found the Wetlands, Hurrah box yesterday.<br/>
Its been WAY too long since I've gotten out and actually boxed, it was great.<br/>

I'll have to verify/replace soon.  Waldo probably got washed away a couple weeks ago when it was just DUMPING rain (he was near a drainage ditch, after all).<br/>
