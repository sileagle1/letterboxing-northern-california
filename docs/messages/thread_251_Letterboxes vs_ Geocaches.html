&gt; &gt; We just moved one of our letterboxes"Unal Trail" that was placed on <br/>
&gt; &gt;4/19/2002. On 6/26/2004 some geocachers had the cajones to put their <br/>
&gt; &gt;cache right next to our letterbox. Since we have had bad experiences <br/>
&gt; &gt;with geocachers in the past we decided to let them have the spot and <br/>
&gt; &gt;find another location. We then posted a fairly tactful message on <br/>
&gt; &gt;their cache/log page to reflect the intrusion. I am not suggesting <br/>
&gt; &gt;that you do the same, but I made sure that the geocachers had <br/>
&gt; &gt;several caches in the area. Hopefully they will take my note <br/>
&gt; &gt;properly and not start vandalizing letterboxes. <br/>

The people who were with me at that time heard some very vile and colorful language pouring out from my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I get more disturbed by the fact that the box is missing for current hunters, rather than wail and moan over the work I put into carving the stamp and assembling the box (besides, repetition is great practice and refines stamp carving skills). Yes, it is a big pain in the derriere to replace it, but as far as I'm concerned, planting boxes is an act of giving. So you either give again, or give something else.<br/>
<br/>
In my case, I haven't gotten a response to my polite request to work out a common solution from the geocacher with a cache in the same location where "Nepenthe" used to reside. That's very irritating. I'm hesitant to replace "Nepenthe" at the moment. The box can't be placed very far away from where it was -- it would lose much of its intent. And, in this case, I want to give again. So I wait... maybe their box will go MIA. (Don't look at me! I'd like to think I'm above that kind of retaliation.)<br/>
<br/>
So... now I've added a check for nearby geocaches to my many other concerns that I try to consider when planting urban letterboxes: disguises, weatherproofing, the right clues and directions, aesthetics, animals, and so on...<br/>
<br/>
What's a parent to do?!! When it's 10:00 (and the streetlights have come on), do you know where your letterbox is?<br/>

The longer you are in letterboxing the more you are going to have some sort of a interchange with geocachers. Unfortunately we have had our share of negative contacts from a geocacher taking over our letterboxes and putting GPS cords in the logs for a 6 box/cache series to placing their cache next to our letterbox. I too have joined the geocache group so that I might add a report to their cache page. I do( I know this might be hard for some folks to believe) write fairly tactful notes on their pages as creating a LB/Cache war serves no one. If you would like to view a sample check the geocache area zip 93238, and the title is Tubatulabal. In this case I opted to let them have the location as our letterbox worked well in another spot.<br/>

family around the country.  We recently found a geocache/letterbox <br/>
in Tennessee that had a nice twist.  It had two logbooks, each <br/>
packaged separately and clearly marked.  It also had instructions <br/>
for the geocachers that they were to log in but not take from nor <br/>
leave any item in the box.  The letterbox stamp was packaged with <br/>
its log.  Each logbook was marked appropriately and no "stuff" was <br/>
within.  It was a refreshing find.  And I guess the grown-up <br/>
geocachers were satisfied with their find and log - no need for <br/>
trinkets.<br/>
