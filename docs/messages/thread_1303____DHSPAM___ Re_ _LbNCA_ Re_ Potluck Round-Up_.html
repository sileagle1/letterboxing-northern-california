<br>
I'm still making my grocery list - and might abandon cupcakes in favor of<br>
some other snack (since we have brownies and 'something sweet' on the<br>
list) - and will see if perhaps I can't get some corn prepped, or some<br>
meat to grill, and maybe some chopped onions or other condiments.  I had<br>
been thinking of those stacks of burgers from Costco myself - they are an<br>
efficient and affordable way to do group grilling.<br>
<br>
It sounds like no matter what we all end up bringing, there will be a lot<br>
of delicious food!<br>
<br>
I also want to mention - I have a new Personal Traveler that will come<br>
with me to the BASS.  To get it, all you have to do is name my favorite<br>
singer/songwriter.  That information can be found on AQ and the PT is<br>
listed there as well.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to Sunday -<br>
<br>
