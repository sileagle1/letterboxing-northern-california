<br/>
I'm still making my grocery list - and might abandon cupcakes in favor of<br/>
some other snack (since we have brownies and 'something sweet' on the<br/>
list) - and will see if perhaps I can't get some corn prepped, or some<br/>
meat to grill, and maybe some chopped onions or other condiments.  I had<br/>
been thinking of those stacks of burgers from Costco myself - they are an<br/>
efficient and affordable way to do group grilling.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like no matter what we all end up bringing, there will be a lot<br/>
of delicious food!<br/>
<br/>
I also want to mention - I have a new Personal Traveler that will come<br/>
with me to the BASS.  To get it, all you have to do is name my favorite<br/>
singer/songwriter.  That information can be found on AQ and the PT is<br/>
listed there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to Sunday -<br/>

&gt; Mushrooms are good for grilling!  Corn on the cob wrapped in foil, too!<br/>

&gt;&gt;    On my sign up, when I said "something veggie," I was<br/>
&gt;&gt; thinking to bring things that could be grilled, bell<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; In looking over the list, condiments are<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; missing.....ketchup (catsup),<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; mustard, relish, onions, etc. Perhaps someone that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; hasn't signed up<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to bring something as of yet could consider these<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; items.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Personally, I don't think anyone should have to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; bring "grillables" for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; everyone. It would work much better if each of us<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; brought our own<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; hotdogs/hamburgers or "grillable" of choice and the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; buns, then a dish<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to share or other shareable items.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; For 1, 2 or even 3 people to have to bring the meat<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; for all, plus what<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; they have already volunteered to bring seems to me<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to be a little<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; excessive.<br/>
