<br>
I would discourage you from planting hybrids.  Ask yourself this, why<br>
do you want to combine the two boxes?  Typically, people who are<br>
thinking about planting hybrids have two answers:<br>
<br>
1. To encourage those who are geocachers to "make the jump" into<br>
letterboxing.  Especially in areas that have few letterboxes to begin<br>
with.<br>
<br>
There's the problem with that logic, however.  Once a geocacher finds<br>
the cache, it's worthless to them as a letterbox since they'll already<br>
know where the box is!  You'd be better off hiding a geocache and<br>
letterbox close, but keep them as two distinct entities.  Then, in the<br>
cache, provide clues for the nearby letterbox.  Not only will<br>
geocachers learn about letterboxing, but they'll even have an<br>
opportunity to find one.  Much better, all things considered.<br>
<br>
The other answer people give:<br>
<br>
2. There aren't many letterboxers in my area and if it's not a hybrid,<br>
the box may never get any visitors!<br>
<br>
In a case like that, it's basically just a geocache if only geocachers<br>
are visiting a hybid.  Why waste your time carving a stamp if nobody<br>
who visits will appreciate it, or if they do, are likely to take it<br>
and replace it with some cheap toy from a Cracker Jack box?<br>
<br>
On a more personal level, if you check out my tutorial on Creating<br>
Great Letterboxes at<br>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/GreatBoxes/ you'll notice<br>
the one thing I really try to hammer down is "Choose Your Audience". <br>
The more specific an audience you can identify for your box, the<br>
better it will turn out.  If you can't even decide to make the box for<br>
a letterboxer or a geocacher, your box will be destined for, at best,<br>
the rank of mediocre and you'll get a reputation for hiding, at best,<br>
mediocre boxes.<br>
<br>
So yeah, I'm definitely on record as an 'anti-hybrid' kind of guy. <br>
Hasn't stopped others from hiding hybrids, though.  ;o)<br>

I read your page on making good boxes, and while I think knowing your<br>
audience is good, I also find that the main difference between a<br>
geocacher and a letterboxer is that a geocacher is less interested in<br>
the craft portion of the sport, and the letterboxer would rather have<br>
a puzzle to solve and a good, hand-made stamp than anything else.<br>
Geocachers love puzzles, too.<br>
<br>
A geocache doesn't need to be exactly at its coordinates, either. In<br>
fact, my opinion of hybrids is that they're too easy to find if the<br>
coordinates are for the hybrid cache, and not for the start of the<br>
clue trail. Many geocaches are called "offset" caches, where the<br>
coordinates given are near the cache, but you have to solve a puzzle<br>
or follow some clues to find it (much like in letterboxing, where you<br>
get information on the start of the trail, and follow the path to the<br>
box, sometimes using a compass to help navigate).<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the advantage of a hybrid box is that it reduces<br>
the impact on the environment, by only having one place for people to<br>
look. If you place two boxes, say a couple hundred feet from each<br>
other, then you have the letterboxers going to find their box, and the<br>
geocachers going to find their separate box. Both groups may end up<br>
trammelling the area a bit more than if the boxes were in one place.<br>
Geocachers often use existing trampled grasses to help them find a<br>
cache-- they're more likely to find the letterbox on accident and<br>
wonder why the cache has a stamp in it. Conversely, if the letterboxer<br>
misreads the clues or gets off track, they might wonder where the<br>
stamp is when they find the geocache.<br>
<br>
That's the reason I would give for "why do you want to place a<br>
hybrid?" It's an interesting site that members of both groups would<br>
enjoy, but I would want to localize the potential impact to one spot<br>
in the area.<br>

One of our first letterbox finds was a letterbox/geocache hybrid in <br>
Alameda.  It was fun, until we realized a geocacher had taken the <br>
letterbox stamp in exchange for some other trinket.  This is a <br>
persistent problem with hybrids since many geocachers do not <br>
understand the purpose of the letterboxing stamp.<br>

who visits will appreciate it, or if they do, are likely to take it<br>
and replace it with some cheap toy from a Cracker Jack box?<br>
<br>
On a more personal level, if you check out my tutorial on Creating<br>
Great Letterboxes at<br>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/GreatBoxes/ you'll notice<br>
the one thing I really try to hammer down is "Choose Your Audience". <br>
The more specific an audience you can identify for your box, the<br>
better it will turn out.  If you can't even decide to make the box for<br>
a letterboxer or a geocacher, your box will be destined for, at best,<br>
the rank of mediocre and you'll get a reputation for hiding, at best,<br>
mediocre boxes.<br>
<br>
So yeah, I'm definitely on record as an 'anti-hybrid' kind of guy. <br>
Hasn't stopped others from hiding hybrids, though.  ;o)<br>

with you. From what I've learned of letterboxers, they<br>
are very respectful, volunteering to adhere to both a<br>

pastime. I don't have the same knowledge of geocaching<br>
or geocachers. Also, why bother with writing<br>
interesting clues for a box if you can just pick up a<br>
GPS and pinpoint its location? To me, that is like<br>
sweating to climb a mountain and finding that I could<br>
have driven to the top. In the end, though, I think it<br>
is really the planter's perogative about what he or<br>
she wants to do. I just know that I don't put hybrids<br>
at the top of my "must-find" list.<br>

<br>
Ack!  That just sends shudders down my spine.  You shouldn't be seeing<br>
ANY trampled grasses to location a letterbox or a cache.  That's part<br>
of the Leave No Trace ethics--that includes trampling paths to boxes<br>
or caches.  If a box or cache is causing a trampled path to be formed,<br>
it should be PULLED or turned into a word-of-mouth clue to limit the<br>
numbers of people finding it.  It's never okay to trample the environment!<br>
<br>
Saying it's okay to trample a path is the type of thing that will get<br>
both hobbies banned from otherwise receptive parks.<br>
<br>
> Personally, I think the advantage of a hybrid box is that it reduces<br>

<br>
On one of my trips to Sequoia National Park, I was surprised once when<br>
a group of us were going to cross a meadow, the rangers instructed us<br>
to fan out and NOT follow each other.  There were no paths through<br>
this meadow and the rangers did not want one to form.  By fanning out<br>
and each taking our own route across the meadow, it didn't trample<br>
down a single path that others might be inclined to follow later, and<br>
it meant any individual person would have a limited impact on the terrain.<br>
<br>
My point in this story is that "reducing the impact on the<br>
environment" is relative.  If there are large numbers of people in an<br>
area, a single trail will have the least impact overall.  If it's a<br>
single fairly large group of people invovled, spreading out actually<br>
reduces the impact on the environment.  The combination of<br>
letterboxers and geocachers might trample an unwanted trail, while<br>
separating the two could reduce the impact to unnoticeable levels.<br>
<br>
There's a lot of factors that go into it, but a well placed box or<br>
cache shouldn't cause such issues in the first place.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong--I'm not trying to diss geocaching.  They face the<br>
same problems letterboxers do.  Each has its attraction to different<br>
people and that's fine--my contention is that in most cases, it's best<br>
to keep the two hobbies seperate for no other reason to make members<br>
of both hobbies enjoy themselves more.<br>
<br>
But any talk of trampling the environment burns me the wrong way. <br>
It's not a problem limited to geocaching either--I've seen it happen<br>
with letterboxing too.  But if a box or cache is trampling a trail,<br>
it's a badly placed box and something needs to be done about it.<br>

<br>
I should probably make this clear. I live in the central coast of<br>
California. Your choices in a typical meadow here are either: long<br>
grasses in wintertime, or long dry grasses in summertime. The grasses<br>
get "trammelled" in the sense that, if anyone's been through in the<br>
last 3 days, you can tell. It's just the way it is. Same with when the<br>
box is hidden underneath a bush-- the bush has to be ruffled a bit to<br>
find the box-- you can tell. If you can't tell, it's usually because<br>
you're not paying attention, not because everyone is so uber-stealthy<br>
they don't even leave footprints.<br>
<br>
Frequently, I might add, the "someone" who's been through is a deer--<br>
a geocaching buddy of mine and I ended up waaay off-trail 2 weeks ago<br>
by following a deer path on accident to what we thought would be the<br>
cache location.<br>
<br>
This doesn't mean the area is destroyed. It means that you see about<br>
the same impact one would expect of a hiker walking 20' into the woods<br>
to take a whiz. But when you have an extra 100 or so people visiting<br>
the site a year.... it can add up. To think that no one will ever<br>
leave any trace on their way to or from a geocache or letterbox... is<br>
a little naive, don't you think?<br>

I would like to point out the irony that Ryan is also a Central <br>

<br>
It may not be a 100% attainable goal, but it's a worthy one.  Just<br>
because world peace and a hunger-free world isn't likely to happen in<br>
our lifetimes doesn't mean we should give up on them either.<br>
<br>
Leaving a letterbox is a violation of the "Leave No Trace" principal<br>
as well, though the spirit of the hobby kind of requires it.  I'm<br>
generally okay with it, though, since a well-planted box shouldn't be<br>
seen except by those who are out to look for it.  Trampled down<br>
trails, though?<br>
<br>
No, tis better to find a hiding place that doesn't require anyone to<br>
trample new trails.  Some terrain is perfectly suited for hiding boxes<br>
well off the beaten path so I'm not saying people shouldn't hide boxes<br>
off trail--just that care must be taken to make sure trampling of<br>
vegetation doesn't happen.<br>
<br>
Next time you find a trampled down area as a result of a letterbox or<br>
geocache, try asking a ranger how they feel about it.  Then ask them<br>
if they'd be supportive of letterboxing and geocaching.<br>
<br>
No, it's in our best interests not to create trampled down trail to<br>
letterboxes, and any box planted that requires doing such a thing is<br>
poorly planted.  The person who planted it isn't a bad person or<br>
evil--they just need to be educated on better hiding places and the<br>
reasons they're necessary so it won't happen again in the future.<br>

One of our first letterboxes(Shore Bird in Huntinton Beach, <br>
1/13/2001) was "Loved" to death. We planted it 3 feet off trail <br>
under a bush, and there was so much traffic that the 3 ft. distance <br>
was worn down and the bush took a beating. The letterbox was <br>
discovered by some folks and removed. We subsequently replanted it <br>
in an area that was more appropriate. Since that time we make sure <br>
that the area we choose for our letterboxes would not be impacted by <br>
traffic. Yes that can be done, just look for areas that are a little <br>
more barren than the grassy hills, and such. It is a worthy goal to <br>
try to keep our impact to a minimum, and I don't consider that being <br>
naive.<br>

If I do go off the trail for a box,I make a point of taking the most <br>
indirect route. For instance, from a trail twenty steps to a tree, I <br>
wont make a bee line straight to the tree. I walk farther up the <br>
trail and find a less/not traveled course to said tree. If I spot <br>
signs of trampling I try to avoid that same area when possible(isn't <br>
always though).-WW<br>
