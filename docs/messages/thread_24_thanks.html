Thank you Aliens!  As a matter of fact, I do have a 4 stamp series <br/>
all ready to go!  This one will be sort of partnered with your alien <br/>
series out at the shore.  But this one is meant to go out on the <br/>
other point, a long hike indeed.  When my foot is healed up a bit <br/>
more, I'll go put it out.  (broke it this summer, and I'm still limited <br/>
to short hikes) <br/>
<br/>
Also, one new box will go out at Sibley Park tomorrow.  My <br/>
letterboxing class is having their first REAL letterboxing trip there <br/>
so they wanted to place one as well as look for boxes.  I can't <br/>
wait to see them find their first outside of school box!<br/>
