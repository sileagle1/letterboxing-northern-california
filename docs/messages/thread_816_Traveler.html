<br>
There are no rules in letterboxing. For example, I was talking with Princess <br>
Lea at the Gabbering and she told me she counts a hitchhiker as a "F" (find) <br>
while we count them separately. Conversely, we count National and State Park <br>
stamps as finds and she does not. If you want to designate "PT" for personal <br>
traveler and count them separately (as we do "S" for states we've boxed in) just <br>
do it!!<br>

What do you mean when you wrote: we count National and State Park <br>

Are they letterboxes hidden in parks or where are the stamps from?<br>

<br>
National and (most) State parks have their own rubber stamps you can get at <br>
the check in point or gift shop just for the asking. There are "passports" you <br>
can buy to collect them but we stamp them into our log books. The stamps state <br>
the name of the park the date and sometimes an image of said park. <br>
Lighthouses all have them with lovely images of the lighthouse. We have Yellowstone, WY, <br>
Mt. Rushmore, SD, Lewis and Clark, WA and several others. <br>
<br>
In California, each park has a 1" X 1" stamp depicting an activity the park <br>
or area is known for like gold mining, flour milling or something like that. Of <br>
course, you have to be there when the kiosk or gift shop is open. In the <br>
summer, they're open a lot but off season is a little tougher. Just ask them to  <br>
stamp your book when you visit a park. Most have them. <br>
