And along the way, I swung by Aahz's Gas Guzzler letterbox.  Whew! <br/>
Obtaining and re-hiding that box took the kind of stealth that Robb<br/>
refer to as "now I'm going to have to fake a seizure."<br/>

Quite wicked, in many ways, is our Aahz!<br/>

I must admit to having failed to find the second box.  That's my<br/>
pattern this weekend.  Find the first.  Fail the second.  Enjoy the<br/>
whole experience mightily!<br/>

Gas Guzzler is, as reported, exceedingly difficult to retrieve/return,<br/>
though it's clearly visible to all who pass.<br/>
<br/>
Cop Shop, on the other hand, is essentially invisible.  You're much better<br/>
off feeling for it rather than looking for it.<br/>

Glad you still had fun, Lisa!<br/>
