<br>
And along the way, I swung by Aahz's Gas Guzzler letterbox.  Whew! <br>
Obtaining and re-hiding that box took the kind of stealth that Robb<br>
refer to as "now I'm going to have to fake a seizure."<br>
<br>
Quite wicked, in many ways, is our Aahz!<br>
<br>
I must admit to having failed to find the second box.  That's my<br>
pattern this weekend.  Find the first.  Fail the second.  Enjoy the<br>
whole experience mightily!<br>

Gas Guzzler is, as reported, exceedingly difficult to retrieve/return,<br>
though it's clearly visible to all who pass.<br>
<br>
Cop Shop, on the other hand, is essentially invisible.  You're much better<br>
off feeling for it rather than looking for it.<br>
<br>
Glad you still had fun, Lisa!<br>
