Hi, I don't know if this is the correct way to post, so I will just see if<br>
it works. <br>
I have planted and helped friends to plant a few hitchhikers late last year.<br>
I never have heard if anyone ever found them or where they have travelled<br>
to. Let me know if anyone has come across any of these: Angel, Birthday<br>
Bear, Birthday Bones. <br>
Also, when you plant a hitchhiker, how do you change out the book if you<br>
never know where it is? Do you put something in the book that asks people to<br>
contact you if it is full? If it is full, how do you replace it if it isn't<br>
near you? Do people ever see their hitchhikers again? Let me know your<br>
experiences. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bonedoc<br>

We found Birthday Bear in the Sacramento City Cemetery on January 1st and <br>
just found a letterbox large enough to accommodate it last Sunday (9th). We <br>
planted it in a box we found "somewhere in Sacramento". So it's alive and well. I <br>
really can't remember how many people had signed in but if you're really <br>
interested, contact me off list and I'll tell you which box I planted it in and you <br>
can check on it. However, I already posted to the list that I planted this HH <br>
in a box "Somewhere in Sac" so someone might have gotten it already.<br>
<br>
Also, when you plant a hitchhiker, how do you change out the book if you<br>
never know where it is? Do you put something in the book that asks people to<br>
contact you if it is full? If it is full, how do you replace it if it isn't<br>
near you? Do people ever see their hitchhikers again? Let me know your<br>
experiences. Thank you.<br>
If you want a HH back, post a note on the main board (LbNA) with "HH (name) <br>
called in" in the subject line. I see that all the time. Also, often, if <br>
someone finds a full log book, HH or regular Lb, they will notify the planter and <br>
tell them about it. We had that happen and we asked the person to mail it back <br>
to us. We let him keep the box (to use to plant his next box) as a 'thank you' <br>
and so postage would be cheaper.<br>

I wrote to the group awhile ago, asking if anyone knew who planted Birthday Bear. You didn't put an email address in it for me to let you know I found it at Alien. I think I was first finder and it was getting dark so I took it with me and didn't notice it didn't get stamped in to Alien's box. Usually it is the responsibility of the person who puts a HH in a box to stamp it with that box's stamp. I usually try to check, but not if circumstances are against me. I can't recall right at the moment where I left it, but when I get home I will check for you. Thanks for planting hitchhikers, and don't forget to identify yourself in them!<br>

I just joined this list so I never did see the email that questioned who<br>
placed Birthday Bear. Little Bear placed it in honor of her birthday. I was<br>
pretty sure she had stamped it in Alien's book first, but I can't recall if<br>
I double checked or not. October feels like a lifetime ago. Usually there is<br>
contact info on everything we put out but I guess we missed that one. I<br>
wonder if it happened to any of the others. In any case, Black Cavalier has<br>
it in possession at the moment and offered to add the contact info into the<br>
book for her. Very cool.<br>
We'll get the hang of all of this someday. Congrats on your F100. Wow. How<br>
long have you been doing this????<br>
