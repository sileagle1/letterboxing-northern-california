I 2nd Mim's suggestion.  Although her offer of her home is gracious<br>
and inviting, perhaps a  park with a group of tables, lots of shade<br>
and no fee would work better for such a large group.  It could be a<br>
potluck or everyone could just bring their own lunch.  I suggest that<br>
it be somewhere in the Wine Country.  That area is such a "hot bed"<br>
for some outstanding boxes that if anyone wanted to come a day early<br>
or stay a  day after they could get their "Lb fix" and up their F<br>
count considerably.<br>
<br>
Saturday was such a wonderful day in every way.  I am in awe (a mixed<br>
emotion of reverence, respect, dread, and wonder inspired by genius,<br>
great beauty, sublimity, or might) of the cleverness and talent of<br>
this group of people.  From the excellent and beautiful carvings, to<br>
the cleverness of clues and preparing and hiding boxes.  <br>
<br>
Even those coming from afar, as did Lee and Nancy, managed to carve<br>
and plant 3 excellent theme stamps for the occasion.  LaLoka's clue<br>
was so appropriate for the day and she managed to come up with it just<br>
by checking out the Old Sac site online.    <br>
<br>
Black Cavalier's "Fanny" was a physical and mental workout...... <br>
everyone should have a "manual escalator like that or......maybe not!"   <br>
<br>
Thanks to all and especially to Sally for planning this wonderful<br>
event, which I'm sure has got to be the BEST GATHERING, as of yet.<br>
<br>
I must say, I am a little disappointed in the appetites of this group.<br>
 I baked and baked and very little was eaten.  I still had as much as<br>
I put out, in the car.  I took it all out to my grandson's mountain<br>
bike team and even those ravenous teenage boys and their parents<br>
couldn't finish them off, so I ended up sending the rest home with<br>
various ones.  Next time, eat up!!<br>
