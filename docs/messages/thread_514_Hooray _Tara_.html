I suggest that if he enjoys long hikes to hunt for the boxes hidden <br>
on Pleasanton Ridge and Morgan Hill Territory(wonderful places for <br>
taking a long stroll). If he can hunt down an old orienteering map he <br>
can have some fun hunting for Randy Hall's Sunol box(spectacular <br>
place to sit and have lunch). The box was still there this past fall <br>
and only a couple of folks have found this one. The plus to this box <br>
is that it still has Randy's stamp; regardless of what Randy <br>
suggested, those that have stamped in haven't changed the stamp. This <br>
box is a classic for the clues, location, and who planted it- which <br>
makes for a wonderful rare find for your logbook.<br>
