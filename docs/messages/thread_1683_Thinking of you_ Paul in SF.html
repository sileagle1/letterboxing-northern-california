  I am so glad you were able to "listen" to your body's call for help and heeded that call so approprately.  I wish you all the best in your recovery and hope that it all continues to go as smoothly as it has thus far.  <br/>
<br/>
  Amazing the little "surprises" that life sends us along the way...  <br/>

  Take care--<br/>

          Sorry I missed the SF event, even though I signed up for it.<br/>
<br/>
As I was getting ready to leave for the event on Friday, I got a pain in my<br/>
chest, and tingling down my arm. I went to the Emergency Room at Davies<br/>
Medical Center, where they diagnosed a mild heart attack. I was immediately<br/>
treated with a heart catherization, and stayed overnight at the hospital. I<br/>
was released the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
I'm feeling OK, and resting at home.<br/>
<br/>
Hope the event was fun.<br/>
