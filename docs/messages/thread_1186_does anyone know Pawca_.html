We get "Contact the Placer" notes quite frequently. I'm not sure <br>
that a placer can turn this function off. I know they can turn off <br>
receiving the 'Found" or "attempted" feature(Flag function). <br>
The 'Contact the Placer" feature doesn't indicate that the letterbox <br>
has been found, it only directs a note via the LbNA system. If their <br>
address isn't current at LbNA then it obviously won't go through.<br>
Sometimes if the placer is not used to answering the C the P notes <br>
they will hit their 'reply' button to answer and that only will send <br>
the note back to LbNA and not to the sender. I know when we first <br>
started using that function several of our replies went into a black <br>
hole as we just hit the reply button. <br>
