#1 letterbox has reappeared!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you unfamilar with this particular letterbox, here are <br/>
some fun facts to know and share:<br/>
<br/>
- this was my first planted letterbox, and quite complex for a starter<br/>
- the clues were channeled to me by Hitchcock's spirit<br/>
- it will make you dizzy or feel faint<br/>
- 'Vertigo' was Hitch's 'valentine to San Francisc'<br/>
- there is a 'Vertigo #2', planted by Princess Lea<br/>
- this replant is in honor of Mimulus, as it's her favorite letterbox<br/>
- I've watched the movie at least 57 times<br/>
- it's much better disguised this time - hooray!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So, rent, buy, or put 'Vertigo' as #1 in your Netflix queue, and get <br/>
busy!<br/>
<br/>
Also, 'Notus, the South Wind' may have blown away -- but I haven't <br/>
confirmed it yet, so you may want to wait a bit before looking for it.<br/>
<br/>
With acrophobic immediacy, yours truly,<br/>
