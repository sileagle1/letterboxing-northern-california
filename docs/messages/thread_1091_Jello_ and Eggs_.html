                    <div class="plaintext-content">I heard the radio piece on KQED's Forum about this show, and filed the<br>
April Fool's Day re-apearance of the Jello City as "too far in the<br>
future to think about."<br>
<br>
But who knows???  Maybe Robb and I could be there.  Stranger things<br>
have happened.<br>
<br>
I still would like to invite folks over to decorate Ukrainian Easter<br>
Eggs.  I'm not sure of a date, yet.  Easter is April 16th, I believe.<br>
 I often do this event on a Monday night, so that friends who are<br>
"running shows" can attend.  I'm not sure how many friends our<br>
apartment can reasonably hold...<br>
<br>
I can't remember if I shared this link or not.<br>

Stay tuned!<br>
