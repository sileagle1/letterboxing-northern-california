Well this is what I get for collaborating with an evil doer like <br>
Snidley Whiplash...he said he would go straight into hiding with <br>
Dudley as his captive, but he stopped to rob a train and then spend <br>
his ill gotten gains on speculative stocks....<br>
<br>
Anyway, public apologies to Grumpy Grinch who beat me to the final <br>
resting place by two days....man these guys are fast.  I wish all my <br>
boxes got action like that.  <br>
