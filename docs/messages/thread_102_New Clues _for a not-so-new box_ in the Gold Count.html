Been awhile since I've visited this group! Dealing with a cross-town <br/>
move and the early part our first pregnancy kind of put a crimp in <br/>
any serious LB pursuits. Finally got out again this weekend to do <br/>
some serious hunting for a five-box round in Folsom - very pleasant!<br/>
<br/>
We planted a box on our last visit to Apple Hill in El Dorado county <br/>
late last fall, but never got around to posting clues until now <br/>
(hangs head). It's an easy, pleasant little spot, but one for which I <br/>
wouldn't necessarily go *too* far out of your way until late summer <br/>
if you want to score some apples and pumpkins while there (though the <br/>
area wineries are *always* good)! <br/>
