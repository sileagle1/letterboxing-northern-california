out this new series of mine, I am happy to announce that they are all in place now!  I gave <br/>
myself the deadline of the "end of summer" to get them all planted, and I finished up on <br/>
Labor Day (cutting it pretty close!)  Who will be firsties on this special series?  It does carry a <br/>
F25 restriction, only because I don't want to scare off newbies who might be enticed by the <br/>
possibility of finding 9 boxes at once - this hike is pretty challenging and could give new <br/>
people an unbalanced view of what this hobby is about.  But if you are on this list and don't <br/>
have 25 Fs on AtlasQuest (this is an AQ only clue), and would like the clues sent to you <br/>
please just email me privately.  Salut!<br/>
