Does anyone know if Tara's Where's Waldo box is still in place?  <br/>
<br/>
We got this image in the fall.  At that time it was under water and<br/>
not in good shape.  We did the best we could to mend it at that time.<br/>
 From the accounting I got from the mtnbikemanns about the first of<br/>
the year, I seriously doubt that it is still available.  When they<br/>
found it, the stamp was in two pieces and once again it was under water.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad, it was an excellent image.<br/>
