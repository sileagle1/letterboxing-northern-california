                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am happy to report on my fantabulous day boxing with Paul and then <br/>
solo.....Vertigo, Eros, Cat and Mouse, Sea Maiden with Paul.  The <br/>
best part was having him as my navigator and copilot for driving <br/>
around town.  I got to see some wonderful sights I would have never <br/>
managed to find if I had been driving on my own.  Plus have lots of <br/>
entertaining conversation and good company.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, after dropping him back at his place where he could continue <br/>
his letterbox planting activities (he is full of ideas for all sorts <br/>
of wonderful boxes), off to GG Park.  I wanted to check outthe <br/>
museum store and cafe at the de Yougn...but it was members preview <br/>
day and the place was crawling with people.  They would not even let <br/>
you in the courtyard, leta lone the gift store unles you were a <br/>
memeber.  Wondering how Lady Hydrangea Prisspot would have handled <br/>
it, I left feeling snubbed and visited the Botanical Gardens across <br/>
the street for a long stroll.  (Paul there is an incredible New <br/>
Zealand Christmas tree near the MLK entrance with amazing aerial <br/>
root system!)  Feelign better, I left to go nab where the Buffalo <br/>
Roam and was stymied by a very chatty male dogwalker who insisted on <br/>
having a conversation with me right near the bench.  I got a little <br/>
annoyed at first and then realized maybe it was not so wise to be a <br/>
lone female far from the street , so I excused my self and headed <br/>
for safety and decided to leave the box for abother day.  <br/>
<br/>
Then tried for Playland....hmmm found the ring of rocks but not the <br/>
right intersection of boulders.  And then, with the setting sun as <br/>
my companion I tracked down the Doggie.  Wouldnt you know there was <br/>
a security guard in a parked car a few hundred yards from said box <br/>
and I pretended to be waiting for a ride.  I surreptiously got the <br/>
box then walked across the street and went into a store with tables <br/>
and stamped in.  Returned with a  drink in hand, like I purposely <br/>
went there to kill time.  Cop still there.  Pretended to stand <br/>
around waiting for my ride.  Walking in circles, checking my watch, <br/>
working up the nerve to replace the box.  Sat down, stood up, Stood <br/>
on the bench, did some yoga stretches, reached over and redeposited <br/>
the box.  Walk around in circles some more, looked at my <br/>
watch.....walked across the street and used the payphone...all in <br/>
eyeshot of the security guard.  This guy just wasn't leaving. I <br/>
almost took the box back to santa rosa with me and I was going to <br/>
mail it to Anna.  Once back at my car (parked where the security <br/>
guard could not see me) I watched the spot where the box is hidden <br/>
for a good 5 minutes to make sure the guard did not come and check <br/>
for a drug drop or something.  Overactive imagination on my part.  <br/>
But that was a fun box, just hard to be discreet with.  A great <br/>
performance, and the guard was probably sleeping on the job and not <br/>
watching me at all!<br/>
