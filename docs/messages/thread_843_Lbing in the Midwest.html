                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks, <br>
<br>
Well I am glad to back in some good LBing territory!  I just <br>
returned from 10 days in the Nebraska and Kansas where I was <br>
visiting family. Unfortunatley due to all the family visiting I did <br>
not have much time for boxing.  Not that the weather was very <br>
conducive....100 degrees and humidity to match.  I did try for a <br>
Funhog box at Standing Bear Lake which is a few miles from where I <br>
grew up.  I could not believe how much things had changed there...it <br>
used to a be surrounded by farmland and miles from town, now it is <br>
surrounded by suburbia.  <br>
<br>
Anyway it was my last day in Omaha and I drug my brother and his two <br>
kids plus my family to the lake where we planted Disgruntled Couple <br>
and Porta Potty.  We then went to find the funhog box. We got <br>
skunked....or at least after narrowing down the location (and then <br>
realizing to my chagrin I did not have my compass) I lost heart in <br>
groping all the possible trees in the vicinity to locate the box.  <br>
IT was hot, humid, itchy (chiggers, mosquitoes and ticks), and full <br>
of thistles, cockleburrs and foxtails and possible rattlesnakes.  <br>
UGh!  How I wished for a nice dry heat.  <br>
<br>
Same news in Kansas...with the added bonus of copperhead and <br>
cottonmouth snakes and poison ivy.  I went with my 15 year old <br>
boyscouting nephew who warned me he had seen a copperhead in the <br>
park where we were searching, so use a stick to probe any cavity <br>
first.  We did find "Comes with the territory" which honors the two <br>
constants of Kansas LBing....mosquitoes and poison ivy.  This taken <br>
from the text of the clues...so I am not exagerrating.  I also now <br>
know how to tell a shagbark hickory apart from a swamp oak. <br>
<br>
But I found 3 boxes in 10 days!  Smirk.  I did really wish I had <br>
more opportunity to do more, but we had not been back in 18 months <br>
so needed to hang with the homies. And do a tour of KC BBQ joints. <br>
THere seems to be a few committed boxers there, but nothing like the <br>
vibrant scene we have here.  <br>
<br>
Here is to all the fun boxes in CA!<br>
