  DKK never cease to inspire me.<br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately, I will probably have to miss the gathering, as late August<br>
  is FarWest show time in Portland (oh, the boxes that await...will I get any<br>
  work done?). If my two cents is worth anything (for an absentee), I'm liking<br>
  the Shoreline Shindig name the best (maybe even shortened like that,<br>
  without the Bay Area or Oakland addenda...Gold Rush Romp held no reference<br>
  to Sacramento and it was a name that really worked). I would be willing to<br>
  carve the event stamp, if the name isn't too dorky. :) That is meant to be<br>
  incentive, not criticism. For me, the shoreline reference holds plenty of<br>
  material for carving: all the nature elements, boats and other watercraft,<br>
  docks, piers, all the attendant ephemera of a day at the beach, and on and on.<br>
  Car buffs could get in there with a convertible with a surboard sticking out<br>
  of it. I know the surf is fairly far away, but maybe it's a WINDsurf board.<br>
  <br>
  I have some containers and other things I could donate for prizes, if the group<br>
  is wanting to do prizes. I also can place an order with BokuBooks and have<br>
  them available to purchase at the gathering (maybe Carole Kat could handle<br>
  for me if I really can't make it). The most popular items at the GRR were the<br>
  little HH sized journals: http://www.bokubooks.com/boku/patterns_leaves.html<br>
  Anyone who wants to cruise the site and let me know what they might like can<br>
  contact me off-list. I will probably try to place the order in the next couple of<br>
  weeks.<br>
