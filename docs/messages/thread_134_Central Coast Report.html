<br/>
Just a report on some boxes on the Central Coast. Added 15 boxes to <br/>
my log book, placed 2, set the Monarch Butterfly HH free and dropped <br/>
off the Sunnyside HH. <br/>
<br/>
The following boxes are alive and well:<br/>
Ocean O<br/>
Shady Coyote (Added a plastic bag to the book)<br/>
The Rock and The Heron <br/>
Gull in the Sky<br/>
Harry Potter Series 3 boxes - All 3 need new books<br/>
Pines by the Sea (Was first finder this is an AWESOME spot &amp; stamp)<br/>
Driftwood by the Sea<br/>
Night Train<br/>
SLO Halloween (my first Buzzard box)swapped the bag as it had a hole<br/>
Palm d' Or<br/>
The Bookstore<br/>
A-Z series "S" stamp<br/>
<br/>
Also stumbled into StampLuis and happened to get another non posted <br/>
box there. <br/>
<br/>
The Stinky Cheese box is missing, but I did dig up a skull of some <br/>
sort of animal. <br/>
<br/>
Planted two more Mission boxes at San Luis Obispo and San Miguel. <br/>
I'll post clues in the next couple of hours<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everybody for the great boxes!<br/>
<br/>

Worked like a crazy woman with a dim flashlight at 8pm but was the<br/>
first to find The Little Bastard Thursday night. We must all think<br/>
the same cause I keep thinking that I'll put one there too... (As a<br/>
cattle person, I hope you all remember to shut the gate on the way<br/>
in and on the way out!)<br/>
<br/>
Fixed up the Mission San Luis Obispo stamp so it's usable again<br/>
<br/>
Found The Other Building and December 26th in SLO and visited<br/>
Jugglermouse too (The Other Building is very cool!) FINALLY found<br/>
the Walking Tour stamp after 4 trips to SLO! Good one Ryan! That one<br/>
made us work!<br/>
<br/>
Found Box one of St. Patricks Flyer but darkness prevented us from<br/>
getting box two or Flutter.<br/>
<br/>
Found Can o Spam in plain sight from our car... tried to hide it a<br/>
little better.<br/>
<br/>
Looked for Nature Box in Avila but couldn't find the trail..<br/>
<br/>
Ryan.. the stamp is missing from the bookstore box. Logbook is there<br/>
but no stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Had a great time.... Thanks to everybody who planted!<br/>

Hello Good People,<br/>
<br/>
Had the good fortune of going to the sunshiny central coast this <br/>
weekend. Here's the latest on some boxes<br/>
<br/>
St. Patricks Flyers - found box one on 12/11 but couldn't find box 2 <br/>
due to darkness. Went back this weekend, saw 25,000 butterflies, but <br/>
still could not find box 2. (several trees fell during the Dec <br/>
storms)<br/>
<br/>
Flutter - alive and well.. beautiful stamp and location<br/>
<br/>
Day and Night Mouse - Alive and well, awesome stamp<br/>
<br/>
My own box .. Money from the Sea was washed out to sea with the Dec <br/>
storms apparently. Will replace it in the spring<br/>
<br/>
Placed a New Box - Elephant Seals just north of San Simeon.. 600 <br/>
pups so far what a sight! Will post clues soon<br/>
<br/>
San Miguel Mission - The clues are all wrong .. (Sorry folks) Will <br/>
fix them ASAP<br/>
<br/>
Mission Soledad - Alive but soggy.. replaced the book today.<br/>
<br/>
That's it.<br/>
Happy Boxing all<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've had a couple of days to settle down from my quickie trip to the San Luis Obispo area, <br/>
and here's my report of finds and attempts for future reference:<br/>
<br/>
FINDS (boxes Alive &amp; Well)<br/>
Little Bastard<br/>
Dead Man's Party<br/>
Moonstone Castle<br/>
Homestead Big Sur (2)<br/>
The Lorax<br/>
Canyon Owl<br/>
Way Cool<br/>
Jade Cove<br/>
Arrrgh! Pirate's Cove<br/>
Mission San Luis Obispo<br/>
Stamp Luis Obispo<br/>
Camelot #2 and #5<br/>
Los Osos Oaks #1<br/>
Send Me An Angel<br/>
Eucalyptus Grove<br/>
Stairway to Heaven<br/>
Mission Nuestra Senora de la Soledad<br/>
<br/>
ATTEMPTS<br/>
Astonishing Creatures: Sea Anemones (I was SUPER bummer this one was missing)<br/>
Big Sur Marathon<br/>
Can O Spam<br/>
Nature Box<br/>
Camelot #3 and #4 (3 appears to missing, 4 is probably still there but I was suffering from <br/>
heat-addled brain and couldn't figure out which tree I was supposed to search)<br/>
Elephant Seals (thanks to Sierra Sally for the short notice clue - unfortuantely it looks like <br/>
the volunteers clean up there quite often and the box was gone - found a suspicious rock <br/>
that should have been guarding it; did see some real elephant seals though, as well as the <br/>
zebras at Hearst Castle!)<br/>
<br/>
I also planted 2 boxes along the way while I was down there.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I was greatly hampered by LbNA being down during the time I was visiting - <br/>
the majority of the SLO boxes are LbNA only and I didn't have printed copies.  I am <br/>
particularly annoyed at missing the Big Sur Vista box for lack of information - I was RIGHT <br/>
THERE.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don't think Stamp Luis Obispo was meant to be a word of mouth only clue, but the <br/>
box is not listed anywhere, not LbNA or AQ.  I think it is safe to mention here on our list: it <br/>
is at the stamp store in SLO, on Chorro St.  It was sitting on top of the cash register, <br/>
patiently awaiting visitors - I was the first to stamp in since 2004!  I meant to get in <br/>
earlier, but seems like every time I am SLO, it is Sunday when the shop is not open.  <br/>
