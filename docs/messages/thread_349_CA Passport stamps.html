Hi all,<br/>
I finally put a page together on the California 150 passport stamp <br/>
locations. You may need to do a bit of research to find specific <br/>
ones. There are some that have very limited hours or that are only <br/>
open seasonally. Hopefully I can get some scans of the stamps posted <br/>
soon. The program officially ended in 2002 but I've been able to get <br/>
most of them anyway.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apparently the server is case sensitive so copy the link or type it <br/>
in carefully. I've also got a list of lighthouse stamps for the US <br/>
Lighthouse Society passport program. I think there are also a number <br/>
of letterboxes at these sites too.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
3vix <br/>
