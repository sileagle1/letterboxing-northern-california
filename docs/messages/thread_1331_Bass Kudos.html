It was so great to meet all y'all.  Dorks Anonymous and I are not,<br/>
generally speaking, folks who go out, but that was way cool!  Thanks<br/>
to everyone for wonderful event excitement.<br/>
<br/>
Dorks Anonymous had tons of fun making the zine, and while this one<br/>
was not for college credit (like the other ones), it was still<br/>
immensly satisfying for him.<br/>
<br/>
We were happy to finally put faces to stamps and AQ/LBNCA postings,<br/>
and most especially to be around artistic, creative people WHO ARE NOT<br/>
FRIENDS FROM WORK!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone who was so warm and welcoming to these<br/>
relatively new-ish newbies.  Thanks especially to Carole for her<br/>
uber-friendliness, Mimulus for scheduling the circus (that was<br/>
overwhelmingly awesome), and Eclipse Tuliphead for proposing the whole<br/>
hoo-rah in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Next time there's a gathering...we're there!<br/>

P.S.  I had a wonderful birthday--Hunter got me a snazzy new backpack<br/>
so I can haul half the crap when we go boxing.<br/>
