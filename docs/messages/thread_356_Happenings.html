Well Jeff and I are going to try to get out this week and do a couple <br>
of Letterboxes along with some Geo's that I have been sitting on for <br>
some time.  Hope the weather cooperates.  Just wanted to let you know <br>
we will not be voting on a date for personal reasons.   Hope you all <br>
can come up with one that will work for everyone and you all have a <br>
fun day. I wanted to say with some help I was able to find the Postal <br>
Forum and I have joined that one also.  Can't wait for a box in my <br>
mail.  Should be fun. Thank you to the person who helped me with <br>
this. Anyway I hope to be posting Sunday night.  Night everyone.<br>
