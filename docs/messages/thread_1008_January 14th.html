Visitor's Center of Point Reyes at 10:00 AM on January 14th, as long as <br/>
the weather is good.  The following are the directions.  FYI, at this <br/>
center there is a gift shop, maps of the park, a California <br/>
Sesquicentennial stamp, a lighthouse stamp and a NPS stamp, in case you <br/>
like to collect those kinds of "extras."<br/>

<br/>
 From there we will probably proceed up to Blackbird's Tomales Point <br/>
series and also do the Alien is lost series.  Then we will probably <br/>
tackle a certain mystery series (cough, cough) that just MIGHT be <br/>
nearby.  If we are not exhausted by that point, we may head over to Mt. <br/>
Tamalpais.<br/>
<br/>
This event will be cancelled if weather is poorly (cold &amp; fog are okay, <br/>
rain is not).  I will try and remember to charge my cell phone and have <br/>
it with me, but who knows what kind of service I will get out there.  <br/>
The number is (510) 387-4484 if anyone needs to contact me/find me that <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
It has come to my attention that the NPS in Marin has recently pulled <br/>
some letterboxes, more specifically those down by the Golden Gate <br/>
Bridge.  I don't know if they have figured out about these boxes up in <br/>
Point Reyes, but I am hoping they are all still alive and well.  If <br/>
anyone is thinking of planting new boxes on the 14th, I would just <br/>
advise keeping the words "Point Reyes" out of your clues so they cannot <br/>
easily be found by a search engine.<br/>
