 I first learned of letterboxing when my local newspaper published <br/>
an article about geocaching and I stumbled onto the below hybrid box <br/>
in SF. (columba) Princess Lea carved the stamp.  It is still one of <br/>
my favorite hunts ever since it is so clever...and you do not need a <br/>
GPS to find it at all.  <br/>
<br/>
But on the whole I like Letterboxing much more and have not bothered <br/>
looking at the geocache sight in months, even though there are <br/>
literally hundreds of geochahes near me.  <br/>
<br/>
And although we own a GPS (my husband is a gadgethead) I have never <br/>
taken the time to learn how to use it and prefer the more Luddite <br/>
version: letterboxing.  I love the handcarved aspect.  To me <br/>
geocaching kind of smacks of many things  I dislike about our modern <br/>
society...disposable plastic "Goodies" and a high tech device that <br/>
represents lots and lots of petroleum (think about all the fuel that <br/>
is required to boost a satellite into orbit.) But at least its get <br/>
people off their couches and out into the woods, hopefully in a <br/>
leave no trace way.   <br/>

So that's my 2 cents worth,<br/>
