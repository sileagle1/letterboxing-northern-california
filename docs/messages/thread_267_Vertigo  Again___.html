                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm... I thought I had responded... maybe I started to, and got distracted. Or maybe Hitchcock's spirit pulled me away to watch Vertigo yet again... <br>
<br>
Anyway, sadly, Vertigo #1 is MIA... but Princess Lea has #2 almost ready to go (once I get off my butt and review her clues for accuracy) AND I have #3 almost ready to go (ditto with me and my clues). <br>
<br>
Replacing #1 is on my "TO DO" list, however. And, doing your homework by solving the word puzzle section (Part One) of Vertigo #1, is going to help you with the other two letterboxes.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, in any case, we'll make you learn quite a bit more about Vertigo than the average acrophobic woman-obsessed man-on-the-street movie watcher. <br>
<br>
Get the movie by all means, and don't just watch it once. Pay close attention to all of the SF locations. And, if I were you, I'd carefully watch the strange lady that runs the McKittrich Hotel - you might get a horticulture tip from her. (Ooops! Maybe I've said too much...!)<br>
<br>
[Princess Lea, I'm going to get back to you VERY soon - sorry! Recently, in a space of just 3 days, I went past and spotted a total of about 6 or 7 of the lesser-known Vertigo locations - I got so excited, I was dizzy.]<br>
