There are no guarantees as to how long this will last but the box is back in action. <br/>
The first edition lasted in its hidey hole for over two years. From an entry in another <br/>
of my letterboxes in the vicinity, I gather that last spring a letterboxer spoke with a <br/>
Ranger about this box and was prevented from finding it. I suspect that said Ranger <br/>
absconded with it. <br/>
<br/>
The last Ranger I spoke with at this park was amenable to having my box there but <br/>
staff changes all too frequently. Not all employees are as agreeable. So I recommend <br/>
using the utmost discretion when searching for this box and avoid talking to anyone <br/>
about it. Funhog<br/>
