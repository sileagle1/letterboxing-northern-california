Having been on the planning committees for the last 2 events, I know <br>
how much energy it requires - I was *so glad* to just be an attendee <br>
this time around!  Thanks also to DoubleSaj and Old Blue for letting <br>
me, Amanda and Ryan crash in Davis the night before.<br>
<br>
Amanda and I had a little post adventure on Sunday we wanted to share.  <br>
We went up to do the Greatest Liar series in the Oakland Hills before <br>
Amanda had to return to work.  All was going well until we got to the <br>
last box which was hidden in a stone tower.  This monument built by <br>
Joaquin Miller is probably about 20 feet tall, and is round.  You step <br>
up into a little room that is about 3 feet off the ground and about 4 <br>
feet in diameter, and then you are "inside" the tower, but there's a <br>
big open "doorway" facing outward.  Anyway, the poor letterbox was <br>
lying in pieces on the floor of this little room (note to Alien <br>
Explorers - I picked up the pieces, but the logbook and stamp were gone <br>
- can return it to you in due time).  Bummer.  Amanda and I decided to <br>
go explore the Woodminster Amphitheater which is about 100 feet away.  <br>
As we are coming back down the path from this side trip, we can see <br>
through some trees that a couple of people have entered the monument <br>
where the letterbox was supposed to be hidden.  So Amanda and I are <br>
intently peering at them, wondering if they are letterboxers.  Here is <br>
some of the conversation that ensues (beware - this is where things go <br>
downhill to the R rating):<br>
<br>
"Hey are they looking for the letterbox?"<br>
"Do they have clues in their hands?"<br>
"The lady just put her head out the door - she has long blond hair, <br>
maybe it's Mimulus!"<br>
"Wait, why is she getting down on all fours?"<br>
"Is there someone standing behind her?"<br>
"Wait a minute, she's not wearing her pants anymore! OMIGOD THEY ARE <br>
DOING IT IN THERE!"<br>
<br>
We were completely traumatized.  Now we have a new answer for our <br>
AtlasQuest interview under the questions What's the worst injury or <br>
hardship you've suffered while tracking down a box?  or What's the most <br>
bizarre thing you've ever discovered while letterboxing?  The worst <br>
thing is that after we slinked away after our episode of voyeurism, we <br>
walked 50 feet to where there were several families with small children <br>
exploring a nearby waterfall.  Is this some new trend we should know <br>
about - having sex at the sites of really good letterboxes to <br>
commemorate the event?  Guess we should be glad we didn't come along <br>
looking for the letterbox while they were actually in there fooling <br>
around!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, what amazing things happen when we're away! We're just <br>
back from Israel, sorry to have missed the gathering (seems <br>
you've had a wonderful time), and a bit shocked to hear the <br>
various news about this box. We'll replant it as soon as we can - <br>
but I wonder if the location is just not secure? Any thoughts on <br>
this? <br>
<br>
Anything else to know about this series? Anything to fix or <br>
improve while we're out there again?<br>
<br>
Also, our young "First President" would love to hear from anyone <br>
who enjoyed the series what you liked.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, here's news from me: I'm (DESPERATELY) trying to <br>
reduce email overwhelm and shifting to "no email" for my <br>
non-work-related groups. I'll check in occasionally, but if anyone <br>
wants to communicate something about our boxes please write <br>
directly if you remember. Thanks! Also, please hit "reply all" to <br>
this message if you write back so it will (hopefully) go to my <br>
individual email, not just the group.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you at the next gathering or on the trails!<br>
