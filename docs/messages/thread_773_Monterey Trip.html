The Gatorlovers are heading to Monterey for a mini vacation next week.  <br>
Does anybody know of some boxes to check out on our drive up or down?<br>
We're taking 101, 1, 680, etc., from Fairfield, CA (Travis AFB)<br>
<br>
We're looking to take in many, so long hikes are probably out of the <br>
question.  Just some drive bys, maybe a little thinkers. <br>
<br>
Thanks for any input.  :)<br>
<br>
Ryan-Could the trip planner include I1 and I5?  Just wondering.  Thanks <br>
for all you do!!  Love the flowers!<br>

Jay's Wharf Cat isn't a driveby, but it is worth the stair climb.<br>

of my favorite stamps. I wouldn't say the location is south<br>
of Monterey, though, it's pretty much right in Monterey. (Maybe<br>
between Monterey and Pacific Grove, really not too far (driving)<br>
from the aquarium.) Also, I really like Princess Lea's Monterey<br>
letterbox. Have fun!<br>
