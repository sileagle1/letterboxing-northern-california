We don't compare to artTrekker, but we could perhaps get honorable<br/>
mention.  <br/>
<br/>
We found our first box April 17th, the day after tax season ended and<br/>
only "dabbled" in a few boxes when we took business trips to Visalia<br/>
and SF.  We did one box in Louisville, KY just so we could set a HH<br/>
free.  As of August 15th we only had F15 and then we jumped in with<br/>
both feet!  We now have F142 plus 8 HH and 22X.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I'm more proud of the miles I've logged than the stamps, but<br/>
if it wasn't for the stamps, I wouldn't have logged the miles, so!!!<br/>
<br/>
We're hooked.<br/>

But this is CA with well over a 1300 miles from North to South and<br/>
hundreds of miles from East to West with lots of traffic and traffic<br/>
jams in between.  But, thanks to you, and many others that heavily<br/>
"seed" an area, it does help to make our week-end count much higher.<br/>

&gt; Lets talk about some real numbers. I figure that you average somewhere<br/>
&gt; in the vicinity of 50 plants per year.<br/>
<br/>
I don't keep up like I used to.  The first year, I probably planted<br/>
over a hundred boxes.  This last year--well, definitely not as many. <br/>
I'm a pretty lazy letterboxer.  =)  It used to be: I'd hike whereever<br/>
I wanted to go and if there was a letterbox in the area, I'd get it. <br/>
And if there wasn't one, I'd plant it.  Naturally, in the "old days"<br/>
of 2001, there weren't too many trails with boxes on them, so I<br/>
planted them as often as I'd find them.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the hobby doesn't seem to need my encouragement to flourish,<br/>
I haven't been hiding boxes as often, and when I do, they're usually<br/>
pretty diabolical clues.  =)  Seed boxes with "different" types of<br/>
boxes rather than the same ol', same ol'.<br/>
<br/>
By my records, I only planted a measily 11 in the past year.  It's an<br/>
embarrassment, really....<br/>

Hey, I forgot to mention another crazy statistic.  Somewhere along <br/>
our letterboxing adventure I started to include our 'attempts' in <br/>
the logbook--the 2nd half of our LB experience to date we logged 56 <br/>
failed attempts at finding a letterbox.  Reading through the notes, <br/>
I realized I forgot to log quite a few more attempts than I had  <br/>
written down.  What's worse is that this 'failed attempt' rate was <br/>
much higher in the first year or so of our letterboxing experience <br/>
(the undocumented time)!  <br/>
<br/>
Most of the failed attempts were due to missing boxes, idiotic clue <br/>
follower (me) and a couple other bizarre reasons (some of which you <br/>
may find rather funny):<br/>
<br/>
-Rock frozen to ground, can of de-icer wouldn't make it budge (Idaho)<br/>
-Box under 12' of snow over snowbank (Idaho--along a river)<br/>
-2 boxes under too much snow (near Snoqualmie, WA in May!!!)<br/>
-Brushfire burned box down to metal sketchbook spine (Hawaii Mystery <br/>
Box)<br/>
-Shots fired in park, police patrol area (we leave out of fear--<br/>
Olympia, WA)  BTW, Olympia's a fairly safe town--it has maybe a <br/>
murder every other year or so...<br/>
-Gale force wind almost blew son off cliff (West Coast lighthouse <br/>
box)<br/>
-Large tree fell over and buried LB beneath it (Rock Creek Park, DC)<br/>
-Box there, stamp missing (Alum Rock Park, CA)<br/>
-1 box under too much snow (Rainier, WA in May)<br/>
-old clues, new box location (owner didn't notify list of new clues)<br/>
-SWAT team moves through park looking for armed suspect, forces us <br/>
to leave<br/>
-LB hiding spot now covered in homeless clothes/blankets (DC)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It goes on &amp; on.  Moral of the story is--sometimes the attempts are <br/>
adventures in &amp; of themselves!  Folks may want to jot down notes in <br/>
their journals about their attempts in the future, too--it's been <br/>
funny to review some of them!  It also gives me a chuckle when I see <br/>
posts from new letterboxers who get rather frustrated about not <br/>
finding an initial box or two along the way.  If they only knew how <br/>
often some of us come up empty handed--it may help boost their <br/>
morale knowing that's sometimes more the norm. ;)  It took me 3 <br/>
times to find one of the boxes in the beginning--we only found it <br/>
after conferring with the planter along the way (one of those Bill &amp; <br/>
Evil Glenn boxes)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure others of you out there have some interesting 'attempt' <br/>
stories, as well?  It would be great to hear about the funnier ones <br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
Again, enjoy the experience &amp; happy letterboxing,<br/>

I planted 19 letterboxes in 2004. Four of them in the Kernville area <br/>
and the rest in Los Angeles County. One is an unlisted bonus box, <br/>
and two are only listed on Atlas Quest. I've planted zero so far in <br/>
2005.<br/>

&gt; Hey Ryan,<br/>
&gt; Lets talk about some real numbers. I figure that you average <br/>
&gt;somewhere in the vicinity of 50 plants per year. We have an average <br/>
&gt;of about 44 per year. Anyone else close?<br/>

We planted 53 letterboxes from Jul-31 Dec 02, 105 during 2003, 31 <br/>
during 2004 and 1 so far in 2005 (12 states &amp; 1 distant foreign <br/>
country) for an average of 47.5 per year (no thanks to 2005 royally <br/>
skewing that stat).  We also carved 4 event stamps which were more <br/>
exhausting than any planted letterbox stamp we've every carved <br/>
throughout this time frame (all that darn lettering in those!!!).  <br/>
<br/>
I don't foresee our 'plant' number climbing all that much anymore--<br/>
we're getting tired of maintaining boxes as they go missing. I'm now <br/>
seriously considering the 'maintain them til they disappear' <br/>
approach instead.<br/>

Hello Buzzard,<br/>
Nancy and I stated Planting some boxes in March of 2004 and also <br/>
planted 19 in 2004 (includes one that I turned into a hitchhiker <br/>
after being vandalized twice), 5 in 2005 so far, and hope to plant <br/>
one or two in Sacramento during the Gold Rush Romp in April.  But I  <br/>
don't dare try to compare with the likes of Don, Ryan or others that <br/>
seem to plant at least 2 a month.<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend we found 3 of your Halloween series (now complete), <br/>
and 3 of your Tiburcio Vasquez series (still need #5), and 3 others <br/>
that I am sure you beat us to.<br/>
<br/>
