                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks a lot for all the emails, unfortunately I forgot to check them<br/>
before I left, so called home &amp; had my wife summarize them.  I was able<br/>
to get all 15 of the original theme park boxes plus the HH, &amp; 3 of the 5<br/>
boxes added on later.  I wasn't able to get Grumpy Grinch's Rattler box<br/>
because I couldn't figure out where exactly he was talking about, nor<br/>
artTrekker's box because her clues were just too confusing after being<br/>
out in the sun all day.  Thanks to those that organized it.  An<br/>
astonishing array of boxes &amp; beautiful stamps.  I bet you were cursing<br/>
Poison Ivy when her's showed up.  &amp; I now have a grudge to be settled<br/>
with the Green Tortuga (just glad I took my heart medicine that day).  <br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned:<br/>
<br/>
1) High boots or look like a dork with your pants tucked into your<br/>
socks.<br/>
2) Always sit with your back to the wind.  I multi-colored many of the<br/>
stamps, but had real problems with the wind drying the ink out before I<br/>
finished coloring.<br/>
3) Skip the 3 "add-on" boxes by Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue, artTrekker &amp;<br/>
Grumpy Grinch, &amp; do them last.  I was able to find the Ds&amp;OB &amp; GG boxes<br/>
in the complete darkeness, with only a full moon &amp; my headlights.<br/>
4) While social trails aren't a good thing, making it obvious that<br/>
there's something hiding under that unusual pile of rocks, they do<br/>
significantly speed up the hunting process when you're fast loosing<br/>
light.<br/>
5) Don't let your daughter play with the flashlight from your boxing kit<br/>
the night before &amp; forget to put it back in your bag.  I had to walk<br/>
back from box #15 under only a full moon, &amp; with only having my<br/>
prescription sunglasses with me, I couldn't see the ridgeline well at<br/>
all, so just had to guess as to where the gravel road might be &amp; hope I<br/>
got close.  <br/>
6) Don't wear black clothes<br/>
7) Bring more than 1 pink marker/ink pad.  I never thought I'd be using<br/>
my pink marker so much.  I think I just about dried it out.<br/>
8) If you rollerblade, wear your wrist braces &amp; knee pads.  I'm really<br/>
serious about this.  Having never worn the braces, I don't know how easy<br/>
it'd be to stamp with them on, but after taking serious falls 3 times,<br/>
twisting both ankles, jamming an index finger &amp; ramming my knee straight<br/>
into a sharp rock, any kind of protective gear would have been smart.<br/>
Or maybe a walking stick instead.<br/>
<br/>
It took me 3 hours from leaving the car, to getting back to the car,<br/>
getting all 15 stamps, the HH &amp; Grumpy Grinch's box that was up on the<br/>
plateau.  This included taking the time to do multi-coloring on about<br/>
half the stamps, but I did serious streamlining of my stamping process,<br/>
&amp; I had the previous social trails that did help out some.  I was able<br/>
to get Grumpy's box by the parking lot, &amp; Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue's box, &amp;<br/>
look for artTrekker's &amp; give up, in about another additional 30 min.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, &amp; if all this wasn't enough, I was also the First Finder of<br/>
California Bear's Mudpot box.  Beautiful hike, but the box stinks (in a<br/>
good way ;-)<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm....  I'm very curious about what that's supposed to mean. I just <br/>
carved a stamp. Don and Gwen were the masterminds who planted the <br/>
boxes. Seeing as I can't think of any reason anyone would have a <br/>
grudge to settle for the stamp I carved, I can only imagine it's <br/>
because D&amp;G planted it in a location that would need some grudging to <br/>
be done. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
That heart medicine is good stuff, huh? =)<br/>
