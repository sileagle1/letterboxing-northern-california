I am still a  little stumped here SO I am hoping someone will take <br/>
pity on me and help me out.  :(  When I go to look up a Letterbox I <br/>
type in what state then the name of it and most of the time the <br/>
placer.  But however sometimes I only have a name of a box.  When I <br/>
put only that info in all that comes up is the disclaimer.  What <br/>
happens then?  I usually am frustrated by then and click off and say <br/>
forget it.  Example is The Kennedy Grove one.  Where are all these?  <br/>
Please help me out.  Thanks<br/>

Just to make sure we are writing about the same functions, are you using Atlas Quest or the LBNA site? If it is the LBNA site and the disclaimer(waver) comes up then it is a good bet that the clue is either not set up under that title,or has been pulled. Why not go to the book, map, state, list, and scroll down the list if you know the area you want to look in? If you are looking in Atlas Quest wait for an answer from Ryan.<br/>

If you're using Atlas Quest....  Hmmm....  Nope, there are no Kennedy<br/>
Grove letterboxes listed on Atlas Quest.  Which would be why they<br/>
wouldn't show up there.  =)  If they used to show up, whoever it was<br/>
pulled the clues from the site.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
