                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was excited to see that artTrekker had dropped her extra Hawaii boxes<br/>
off at the Sacramento zoo.  I am off today (Monday) &amp; had been wanting<br/>
to take my daughter to the zoo for a while.  I was there by 9:30, hoping<br/>
to beat Da Kool Kats &amp; DoubleSaj &amp; Old Blue since I figured they'd be<br/>
racing to get to the boxes too.  My daughter didn't seem to interested<br/>
in the sedentary animals, but loved anything that was awake &amp; moving<br/>
(red pandas, orang-utans, etc).  Unfortunate, my daughter's fear of<br/>
sirens kicked in when the gibbons started howling, but we did have fun.<br/>
It took me a while to get the Aloha Box (bird quiz clue), because I<br/>
missed one of the clue birds since it was tucked away around a corner.<br/>
But, I got to it &amp; was glad to see we were the 1st to stamp in.  I was<br/>
surprised how fast spiders spun their webs around the box in just 2<br/>
days.  The Island Magic box was much tougher ince I couldn't find the<br/>
key landmark the clue referred to.  I wandered around the zoo 3 times &amp;<br/>
couldn't find it.  Finally, it was getting passed my daughter's nap time<br/>
so I gave up &amp; decided to leave.  At that moment, I finally saw the<br/>
landmark.  The box is tough to get to though, because you really have to<br/>
get down &amp; reach it at a weird angle.  So I used my daughter's stroller<br/>
to try to block sight of the hiding place.  As I was reaching for the<br/>
box, a man walked up behind me &amp; stared talking to me.  I thought "Oh<br/>
great, I've just blown this box to the zoo staff."  But then I realized<br/>
the guy was saying "Sorry Black Cavalier, you're not getting First<br/>
Finder on that one."  I stood up &amp; turned around expecting to see Gary<br/>
or Old Blue.  But it was neither, &amp; the lady with him was calling me by<br/>
my real name too.  They finally introduced themselves &amp; I realized I<br/>
could finally confirm the existence of the elusive Grumpy Grinch.  They<br/>
kindly provided cover for me to finally get the box &amp; then left since<br/>
they were on their way out.  So, thanks aT for giving me a good excuse<br/>
to get my daughter to the zoo &amp; the lucky occurance of meeting Grumpy<br/>
Grinch.  It's the 1st time I've met a boxer "in the field".<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were delighted to realize that Black Cavalier was in the zoo at the <br/>
same time we were.  Meeting him "in the field" was a first for us <br/>
also.  Thanks for not jumping out of your shoes as we startled you <br/>
from behind.<br/>
<br/>
We feel ourselves to be doubly fortunate since today we also bent our <br/>
minds enough to interpret Black Cavalier's mystery box, his first <br/>
plant.  It is so clever, once you understand each part of his hints.  <br/>
Thanks for all the fun.<br/>
<br/>
And ArtTrekker's Hawaii at the Zoo stamps are not to be missed!<br/>
