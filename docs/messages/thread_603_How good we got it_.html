check out this old link to letterboxing.org, for some of us new <br/>
boxers it shows how few and far between boxes were around here(and <br/>
all over) just 2 years ago! Really cool and an eye opener. Makes ya <br/>
appreciate the very active planters in our area like Princess Lea, <br/>
Doublesaj and Old Blue, Funhog and Mimulus - and many others of <br/>
course!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Anybody know if any of these North Coast CA. boxes are still out <br/>
there? Some Ive seen on the clues list but most dont appear-?missing?<br/>
retired?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Mim, check out "Shadow of a doubt", I was FF for this <br/>
great little box last weekend. Good film to watch too(although not <br/>
one of my Hitch favorites). <br/>

 Wow, in just a few years so much has happened. I just wanted to let <br/>
you know that Skunk cabbage is still around! It was actually my <br/>
first find less than a month ago. The Redcrest Fairyland was MIA, <br/>
but has been replaced (according to the clue), but I haven't made it <br/>
there yet; plan to soon! <br/>
 I also want to say that by the summer, Humboldt will be rockin', <br/>
letterbox style, so plan a little vacation up this way to cool off. <br/>
Thanks to everyone for giving my family a chance to get out and do <br/>
something fun!!<br/>

number of boxes now compared to 2 years ago!  Looking<br/>
for some of the original boxes would almost be like<br/>
going on an archeological dig!  Sounds fun to me!<br/>
