If we hadn't known we were at another fun letterboxing event, we'd have thought we were at a fancy party--with all the trimmings! I've been telling my non-letterboxing friends (who 'box vicariously through our stories of doing so) to name a food or drink that they would enjoy having at an event such as this and so far, no a one has mentioned anything that wasn't available!! We've given many a part in our days but I can't remember one where seemingly EVERYONE was satisfied. Pizza, sandwiches--veggie ones at that!--gooey salads and veggies, and you even had MY favorite frink; Apricot Nectar! Unbelievable job.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think I was most impressed with the wonderful event boxes and how they were set up. The planning that must have gone into this! <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thank you, 3catFam for such a memorable gathering!<br/>
<br/>
Your fans<br/>
