bike race at the Glory Hole Rec. Area in Angels Camp yesterday.  Since <br/>
we were going to be up that way, we thought it would be nice to leave <br/>
some frogs behind for the Frog Jumping Contest that will be held the <br/>
3rd week-end of May.  The mtnbikemanns left 3 frogs and Da Kool Kats <br/>
left 1 frog and one donkey.  <br/>
<br/>
With these added to the few boxes that are already in the area, it is <br/>
now well worth the beautiful drive.  Hope some of you will make it up <br/>
that way soon. It's beautiful this time of the year. Mid week is much <br/>
nicer than week-ends as far as traffic goes.<br/>
<br/>
We'll get our clues posted this evening.<br/>
