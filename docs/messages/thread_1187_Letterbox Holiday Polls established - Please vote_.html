to call the holiday we celebrated on Wednesday and on the date it <br>
should exist in the future.<br>
<br>
To help make this decision I've created two polls:<br>
<br>
The first poll is to decide which date the holiday should fall on: <br>
http://snappoll.com/poll/99638.php<br>
<br>
The second poll is to determine what to call the holiday: <br>
http://snappoll.com/poll/99641.php<br>
<br>
I tried to include the most discussed options for each topic.<br>
<br>
Voting will close in one week: 6:30pm Pacific Time Next Friday June <br>
2nd<br>
<br>
Here's hoping we can make this decision in a friendly manner and to <br>
the satisfaction of most.<br>

BTW, I left "National" off each of the naming choices as letterboxing <br>
truly is an international hobby and I'm hoping we can embrace all our <br>
foriegn boxers as well.<br>
