So, we didn't have to use our superior Spanish speaking skills to <br/>
figure it out (that is sarcasm for anybody out there--I speak limited <br/>
Spanish and everything I learned was from reading billboards and <br/>
listening to the radio &amp; everybody else around me for that matter <br/>
while we lived in El Paso a few years back).  As for the next season, <br/>
they've selected the most popular &amp; notorious contestants from each <br/>
season to date to participate in the Survivor All Star competition <br/>
(or something like that).  I'm sure Princess Lea knows all of the <br/>
specifics, though, so she can fill us in on the details! ;)<br/>
