few boxes...perhaps if we are lucky the circus sideshow could be <br/>

I live in the north bay...Santa Rosa.  I am open to driving elsewhere <br/>

Also here is a public invitation to Princess LEa, or anyone coming to <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So far all July dates are great for me.  1 of those dates in August could be bad for me depending on when I have the BD party.  I would venture to guess I would go for the 14th since his BD is the 15th, but sometimes with paychecks I have to wait till the following weekend.  I need a bit of time ot figure out pay periods on the calendar.  Like you said Mim it is late so I am off to bed too and will write about this again.  Night<br/>
