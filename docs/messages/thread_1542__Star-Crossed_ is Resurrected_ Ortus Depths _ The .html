&gt; Welcome back Paul!  Where HAVE you been? <br/>
<br/>
I've been making some major life changes. I'm now out on full-time <br/>
disability from work. <br/>
<br/>
I made a decision to focus on my artwork and less on other things -- <br/>
like the 35 activities, including letterboxing, that I try to juggle. <br/>
My paintings have improved significantly this past year as a result.<br/>
<br/>
This week, I had an itch to carve and an idea ready to made into a <br/>
letterbox, so I dove in.<br/>
<br/>
I'm preparing 2 - 3 new boxes based on the old fashioned "cabinets of <br/>
curiosity" that preceded the establishment of natural history <br/>
museums. They were usually 1 or 2 person operations with exhibits in <br/>
converted storefronts and charged cheap entrance admission. Among <br/>
their collections were fossils, taxidermed animals and hoaxes -- such <br/>
as the dessicated monkey with a fishtail sewn on and passed off as <br/>
a 'mermaid mummy'.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. P. Gagnier's Renowned Cabinet of Curiosities will be displayed in <br/>
storefronts, and yes, admission is cheap -- in fact, free! Hoaxes!? <br/>
No way!<br/>
<br/>
My new goal is to take up as much space in peoples' logbooks as I <br/>
can, and I've already claimed a lot of paper, haven't I?<br/>
<br/>
Curiosity item #1 will be ready this week with an absolutely perfect <br/>
storefront to reside in. <br/>
<br/>
