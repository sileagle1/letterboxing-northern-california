                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
I will be there in October and have decided to a gatehring. Vacaville <br/>
has only two letterboxes in it. I would like to seed the area, but as <br/>
this October 7th is up for election of days to plant Mystery boxes, I <br/>
would like it to be a Plant a mystery box event. It will be potluck <br/>
and if you don't have a box to plant thats okay. Also, if you just <br/>
want to plant a normal non mystery box, that's okay too. Right now I <br/>
am planning for Andrews park unless they get the nuttree park done <br/>
before I get there. It will be a potluck. Hoping to see you all there. <br/>
I have the event posted on Atlasquest to RSVP to.<br/>
