Today I was in Micheals purchasing some carving eq. when this lady <br/>
walks up to where I am and pulls a speedball carver off the hook.  So <br/>
me being a big mouth and nosey I asked her what she was going to do <br/>
with that?  Yup you guessed it.  Carve a stamp for Letterboxing.  This <br/>
is my first person that I have met.  I was so excited I proceeded to <br/>
tell her also about Postal LBing and the wonderful get together you all <br/>
had in Sacto last weekend.  I even went as far as to get her e-mail <br/>
addy to send her the link to this group. I will do that tomorrow cause <br/>
I am off to the Movies to see .......House of Wax.   :) TTYS  Michelle<br/>
