                    <div class="plaintext-content">Team Bear Cat will be boxing around Half Moon Bay on Monday and in the<br>
Berkeley/Oakland area on Tuesday.  <br>
<br>
They wanted to know if anyone wanted to meet up, either for 'boxing or<br>
dinner (around 6 or 7pm) in Berkeley on Tuesday.  You can call Nancy<br>
on her cell phone at <br>
<br>
423-255-9526.<br>
<br>
Robb and I plan to meet up with them for dinner.  We've done all the<br>
letterboxes in the area that involve short walks, and aren't up for<br>
the longer walks, yet.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any thoughts on restaurant suggestions.  Unusual,<br>
tasty food, and good lighting were the two things requested.<br>
<br>
They wanted to let everyone know that even though they didn't bring<br>
their travellers with them, they will send stamped images to anyone<br>
who solves the clues.<br>
<br>
Any questions?  You can give me a call at<br>

ps -- Paul, if you want to meet us at a BART station, we would be<br>
happy to pick you up!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I realize that I may be more paranoid than most of you, but posting <br>
phone numbers or other personal info on a chatlist is not a good <br>
idea. Posting someone else's info is even a worse. These messages <br>
get archived and can be googled. Since Ryan and Amanda are not <br>
available to remove messages it will have to be removed by the <br>
poster Lisascenic. This can be done by going to the message and <br>
clicking on the delete button that will be right near the send , <br>
preview, and cancel buttons.<br>
