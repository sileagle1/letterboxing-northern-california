Along the line of trail names and such, I want to give notice that Da<br/>
Kool Kats are changing our stamp. We, or should I say I, was not<br/>
pleased with the way the cat stamp turned out and since we wanted to<br/>
make a smaller stamp to fit into more of the log books, we thought we<br/>
will make one that is indicitive of our boxing trend.  I guess we'll<br/>
have to keep the name, Da Kool Kats, since we're known by it.    <br/>
<br/>
We called ourselves Da Kool Kats on the spur of the moment the first<br/>
time we went boxing because we used a couple of cat stamps we had<br/>
around the house the first time we went boxing, never realizing we<br/>
might continue to "box" or get "hooked".  As anyone that has met us<br/>
knows, we are anything but Kool Kats. ha!<br/>
<br/>
So, if you run into the new stamp with Da Kool Kats signing in, it is<br/>
still us.<br/>

We really enjoyed your old stamp - just love those Kool Kats.  I had to grin when I read this - because as you know - we "renamed" ourselves now that we are ever so hooked on this!  So officially - BugZ, AntZ and ez2love are now known collectively as The Boxalots - coming to a box near you!  It took to long for us to stamp in - so we are thoroughly enjoying our new stamp - of which you have the first impression in your logbook from our Sugar Loaf Ridge Exchange.<br/>
<br/>
We have been busy.  We nabbed the Planet Walk that day up to Neptune.  And were fortunate to meet you Kool Kats and Wascally Wabbit and Flower that day as well.  The MK84 Box peaked our interest - and we finally got that on the 2nd try!  Great job Black Cavalier!!!   We stamped in behind you and Gary in the Sacramento Cemetary Box.  Visited Bucky Beaver, Bucky's Feathered Friend and Scoopy as well.  All are in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
We scoped out Old Sac.  We saw some good spots and good inspirational material.  Just wondering if we all saw the SAME inpsirational material and spots??  But nevertheless - looking forward to the GRR immensely.<br/>
<br/>
Being suckers for torture (but only in the daylight hours!) we journeyed back to SLRSP and did the Sideways series.  What great boxes - but quite the hike!  We stamped in behind Kool Kats in each box (except #5 - we picked up the Black Bear Paw hitchhiker - thanks Mimulus!).  Box #6 is a beautiful stamp!  And we missed Pluto on this trip as well....because....well we aren't sure how we missed it!  Exhaustion maybe!?  Also enjoyed the lovely Pomo Hummingbird.  Mimulus is tireless!  <br/>
<br/>
We are headed down to the Monterey area this weekend.  Any suggestions on what not to miss?  We will be down there for 3-5 days.  Not many prerequisites...after Sideways we feel pretty gung-ho!<br/>
<br/>
After reading about your knees - I am awed by the Sideways hike you did Carole!  Can't imagine how you felt the next day.  Hope you are all well - and neck-deep into tax season.  See you soon on the trail!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, BugZ of the Boxalots<br/>

Dear Boxalots, <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the PR regarding Sideways.  I think Box #6 is my best <br/>
carving so far...if you like that one you may want to go after Rock <br/>
Repose across the Valley...if you have not already.  Similar <br/>
look/but not as nearly "uplifting"...no pun intended.  <br/>
<br/>
I have tomorrow morning off....rats.. too busy today to go with <br/>
ARttrekker and her mom out to SLRSP to do the loop, so maybe I will <br/>
go stretch my legs and check out your new stamp and see how far <br/>
those guys made it.  Or.....maybe off to Marin to get some of those <br/>
Novato stamps.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails all, <br/>
Mim<br/>
<br/>
