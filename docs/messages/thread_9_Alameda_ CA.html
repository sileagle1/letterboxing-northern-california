We live in Alameda, the island just west of Oakland, CA.  We are <br/>
within walking &amp; rolling distance of a few LB sites in or near Crown <br/>
Beach and Crab Cove.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband, Jim Gonsalves, uses a power wheelchair, so we're <br/>
interested in hearing (or reading) how accessible the path of travel <br/>
is to various LB sites.   No, we don't expect all the LBs to be <br/>
wheelchair accessible, just like we don't expect Half Dome in <br/>
Yosemite to be wheelchair accessible, or Bumpas Hell at Lassen.  <g><br/>

What?  Didn't you hear?  They're going install wheelchair accessible <br/>
ramps next summer!  =)<br/>
<br/>
In all seriousness, though, there's always the possibility of taking <br/>
a helicopter to the top.  Lots of landing room!  Perhaps even enough <br/>
for a small plane to land.  Yep, lots of options when it comes to <br/>
Half Dome!<br/>

We have a few letterboxes that are fairly accessible for wheelchairs. The term "accessible" needs some definition depending on the amount of help required. For the last few years I've taken a buddy Dove  and Pheasant hunting that has ALS. He has a power chair that can handle some dirt roads(hard packed) but still requires some hefting on my part, i.e. toting gear, guns, and lifting and shoving. So we help make it accessible. Using that description here are a few that have that type of helping access;  Kern Co., Ca. - Tule Elk, The Babe Lure, Mailbox, The Troll of Kernville, Just Enough Bull.  In Tulare Co., Ca. the Leprechaun among Giants is a 3 season accessible letterbox that was made accessible except for the last 5 feet.  I say was made accessible as the trail was added on to and now goes right by the letterbox. In Eureka,Ca. the Owl and the Donkeys is available. In the Long Beach/Seal Beach area most of the Seal Beach Town Tour would be accessible and all could be reached if some pre planning were used, White by day-blue at night and Signal Hill letterbox in the Long Beach area are available.Our Long Beach State letterboxes would be accessible but have some stairs enroute so pre planning would be necessary.The Stamp Golf game in Long Beach would require motoring over grass, and I just thought of a new measuring unit, "the distance of one revolution of a wheelchair wheel". You have to read the clue sheet to appreciate this comment.  I'm fairly sure Ryan's Great Grandpappy in San Bernardino area could be reached, up to the last few feet. For any travels  to Bingham, Idaho our Gotta Go, and some of Cadenza's letterboxes  could be reached. In Wy. our Remembering Ed letterbox just outside of Cody is totally politically incorrect but very accessible.<br/>
