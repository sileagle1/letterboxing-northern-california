<br/>
I hope yer all staying warm. We have been cccooolllldd here in Tahoe,<br/>
but sure could use some SNOW!!! Wascally Wabbit was in town last<br/>
weekend and I took him to Fallen Leaf Lake and the Tallac Historic<br/>
Site. All boxes were accessible, and there wasn't wind, so it wasn't<br/>
too frigid. The ground has been so frozen that you can mostly just<br/>
walk on the snow. Where others have passed first, at least. It's a<br/>
good time of year to have two dogs!!<br/>
<br/>
I was getting these posts sent directly to my email, but haven't seen<br/>
any in awhile, so I'm glad I decided to check in on the group site.<br/>
<br/>
I crashed my car bigtime on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, coming back<br/>
from visiting my sister in Salinas. I took a detour on the way<br/>
home--to Oakhurst for, um, boxes--and that delayed me enough that I<br/>
didn't miss the storm as I thought I would. On Hwy 88 about 30 miles<br/>
above Jackson, a guy in a big old pickup lost control and spun into my<br/>
lane. He wasn't moving much any more, but I only had time to decide I<br/>
didn't want to slam on my brakes or drive off the road before I knew I<br/>
was going to crash into him. Funky. Just know that there's a reason<br/>
Subaru has a five star safety rating; it was a walk-away. Digger was<br/>
with me and he was completely unhurt. I had some bumps and bruises and<br/>
am still healing a ligament injury in my ribs, but otherwise, I am<br/>
fine. Everyone I dealt with was absolutely great, and I thank my car<br/>
for giving its life for me. I actually have a long list of things to<br/>
be grateful for in this experience. As Carole Kat said, that's kind of<br/>
a tough way to get a new car. And it is, but I'm enjoying the new<br/>
Outback now. Haven't put more than local miles on it yet (still lying<br/>
a little low), but the time will come.<br/>
<br/>
Going to Maui at the beginning of March--has anyone done any boxing<br/>
there? I would love suggestions for boxes, as there seem to be quite a<br/>
few, and my experience on Kauai was that most had commercial stamps.<br/>
I'm sure I'll leave a few, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you're all doing well...can't make it for group boxing at the<br/>
beginning of February, but will plan to be in San Jose the first of<br/>
April. I'm sure it will be great fun, and maybe even kind of warm by then.<br/>

My pal Lock Wench has been hinting that an ArtTrekker stamp for her<br/>
event would fill her heart with joy.  So, now I've passed the hint<br/>
along...<br/>
