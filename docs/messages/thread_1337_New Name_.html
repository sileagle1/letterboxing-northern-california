Several years back, Gwen & I had this great little bet.<br>
<br>
I said it meant Dive into Rocker, and she said it was Divan to Rocker.<br>
We finally asked and were perplexed to find out it was Adventure <br>
Seeker and Bethany somehow had left off the A in her carving.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bethany explained to me that DVN2R CKR is the "family" name, and the stamp they used <br>
when her kids were small to represent that the whole group had found the box.  Now that <br>
her kids are older and more capable of stamping in their own identities (RNRB=Runner Bee <br>
and TRKR=Trekker), mom decided she needed a separate stamp and so now she's <br>
Daelphinus, which is some sort of astral dolphin.  There's also a dad (TRKEE=Trekkie), <br>
although he is often overseas, but I had the opportunity to meet him in Portland at the <br>
Sam Hill gathering.  That's a very elusive exchange to have and I am very proud to have <br>
nabbed it.<br>
