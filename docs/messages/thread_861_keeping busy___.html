yesterday.  He hid another box in his series, and I found the whole<br/>
bunch.  That boy has really taken diguising his boxes to a new,<br/>
demented level!<br/>
<br/>
Today we went after<br/>
<br/>
Columba -- amazing location, astonishing container.  Sure wish we had<br/>
realized that there is more that one box there, duuuuh.  Nice to see<br/>
my NY pal Tamsyn's stamp, in any case.<br/>
<br/>
Ortus Depths -- great spot, stunning stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Playland Lives -- we're idiots and failed to find this one.<br/>
<br/>
Star Crossed -- such a lovely stamp!  Loved the books!<br/>
<br/>
Haunted Mansion stamps -- mixed success.  The stamps we found were<br/>
charming.  We were getting really hungry, and a bit nervous about<br/>
being seen as trespassers near the end of this series, so we cut the<br/>
hunt short at the penultimate box.<br/>
