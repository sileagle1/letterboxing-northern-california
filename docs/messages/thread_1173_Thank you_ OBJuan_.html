beautifully carved "On Guard" letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, to be more honest, I found the letterbox.  Robb can now walk on<br/>
uneven terrain, but scrambling over rocks is way beyond his current<br/>
abilities.  Still, it was a lovely day.  We saw creatures (coyote,<br/>
quail, and my beloved Stellar's Jay), I spotted the rare Mount Diablo<br/>
Fairy Lantern, and we had astonishing views, and breathed a lot of<br/>
lovely fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing was that I really had to clear my mind to find the<br/>
letterbox.  There are apparently an infinite number of paths on the<br/>
"Trail through Time" and I just had to unclutter my mind, and let the<br/>
clues find me.  Very nice, when one is hunting a Jedi's letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I did not, however, have such clarity for the second letterbox in the<br/>
series.  But I also know enough to leave things alone, and not worry<br/>
about the things I can't discover.<br/>
<br/>
I posted a zillion pictures on the blog, including some shots of<br/>
Mimulus Flowers:<br/>
