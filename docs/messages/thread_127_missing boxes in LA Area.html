Grandpa's 75th and Briggs Point Both of these boxes are missing. The <br>
planter had been cleaned out and replanted and the ivy had been cut <br>
back.<br>
<br>
I also looked for a California mystery box and it was missing also. <br>
It is the box you have to FIGure out the clues on your own!<br>
I had the right place. You can't miss something like that. But the <br>
box was no where to be found.<br>
