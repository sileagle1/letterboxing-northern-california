Went out yesterday to the coast and found the "Alien is lost" <br/>
series. Great boxes and locations(there was a park ranger standing <br/>
next to the rock where one box was hidden for 10 minutes!) Anyways, <br/>
we found a HH called "paddler" that originated in Oakland, but there <br/>
was no contact info included and I cant find it on Wanda &amp; Pete's HH <br/>
page. So here's your update.<br/>

NOw you are saying all 3 are there and doing well.  I can't wait to go do this one.  Hopefully 2 weekends from now.  Thanks for the update.   <br/>
