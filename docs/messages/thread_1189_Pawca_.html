&gt; The 'Contact the Placer" feature doesn't indicate that the letterbox<br/>
&gt; has been found, it only directs a note via the LbNA system. If their<br/>

<br/>
I don't know what's going on with the email delivery for this person - <br/>
either she gets them and ignores them, responds to neverland, or has an <br/>
incorrect/rarely checked email address connected with the LbNA site.  <br/>
Maybe a more reliable email address is written in her planted boxes - I <br/>
don't remember seeing one but I rarely write them down.  I did write to <br/>
her the other day through Contact the Placer as she had mentioned a <br/>
National Park in her clues and I was trying to let her know about their <br/>
feelings on letterboxes.  No answer.<br/>

P.S.  Looking forward to seeing everyone this evening<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S.  There was a convergence of letterboxing teams at Dem XX Men's <br/>
Super Mystery! box yesterday.  I bumped into Wassamatta_U and Katie Bug <br/>
as well as some folks up from Orange County: Gerwaiian Oma and Chokato <br/>
who were visiting G.O.'s brother Groggy Froggy,  The exchanges were <br/>
a-flying!<br/>
