<br/>
We went to look for the Schwinn Bike box yesterday.  We found the <br/>
hiding place (under a big pile of rocks) but it appears to be a nesting <br/>
spot for some baby rattlesnakes.  Fortunately we looked before reaching <br/>
in.  The clues did mention looking out for rattlesnakes but we were not <br/>
expecting them to be quite so close!  We did wait see if any of them <br/>
were going to leave but they did not, so we decided to skip this one at <br/>
least for now.  I guess they will probably move on at some point, but <br/>
use extra caution (or a really long stick!) if you want to check it out <br/>
for yourself.<br/>
