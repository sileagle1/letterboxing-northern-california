visitng in-laws.  Going letterboxing with extended family is trying <br/>
at best....especially when it takes 3 hours to hike two miles....<br/>
<br/>
But I guess trying to fit LBing into five people's agenda is <br/>
complicated.   Luckily, aT has some awesome drive bys.  <br/>
<br/>
Not to be missed:<br/>
Canyon Canoers<br/>
Woodsford station<br/>
Totem<br/>
Snowshoe thompson<br/>
Hope Valley flyfisher series<br/>
Grover Hotsprings<br/>
Ebbitts Dragonfly (the location is awesome)  not by aT<br/>
<br/>
I also got da Kool Kats bridal veil falls....very cool stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Plan a trip to Hope Valley....it is gorgeous and should be even <br/>
prettier come fall colors.  <br/>
<br/>
I also planted "Before and AFter" at Grover Hot Springs....look for <br/>
clues to be posted soon. <br/>
<br/>
thanks artTrekker for the great carvings...<br/>
