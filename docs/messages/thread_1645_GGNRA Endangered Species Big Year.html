                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's an article in this Sunday's Chronicle Magazine about endangered species in the <br/>
Golden Gate National Recreation Area.  Apparently there are 33 endangered species found <br/>
here, more than Yosemite, Yellowstone, Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Park combined!  <br/>
There is some kind of informal contest that will be sponsored this year by the GGNRA for <br/>
folks to  try and spot all the species (11 plants, 6 birds, 3 butterflies, six fish, four mammals, <br/>
one frog, one snake and one crustacean).  Something about this just cried out letterbox series <br/>
to me!  One drawback is that the GGNRA frowns upon letterboxes (National Park and all that).  <br/>
I am wondering if there is a way to partner up with the fellow organizing the contest (local <br/>
environmental lawyer Brent Plater) - boxes don't necessarily have to be hidden in the "wild."  <br/>
Maybe ranger stations can host them.  Just fantasizing here....  <br/>

Here's the link to the article if anyone wants to check it out<br/>

This is why I've included several extinct species from the past in the<br/>
"Cabinet of Curiosities". We never learned the lesson of Raphus<br/>
culcullatus!!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever seen the Mission Blue butterfly that only lives on<br/>
Twin Peaks and Bernal Hill? <br/>
<br/>
Buses and carloads of tourists toss litter and garbage onto the slopes<br/>
of Twin Peaks DESPITE a sign that says that it's the fragile<br/>
environment of the nearly extinct Mission Blue butterfly!<br/>
