Thanks Wascally Wabbit, some boxes close by!  Guess who is renting <br>
AG tonight?!  Letterboxing is so fun, if it had not been for LB and <br>
Paul and Princess Lea I would have never rewatched Psycho and The <br>
Birds.  SO now I get a chance to see Petaluma again in AG.  <br>
(Something I have been meaning to do since I moved here 12 years <br>
ago.)  <br>
<br>
There are several other films done around Petaluma ...Mumford and <br>
Phenomenon come to mind. <br>
<br>
<br>
I should also go check on the Napa boxes over Xmas break...not that <br>
far from me really, I just never seem to drive east of Valley of the <br>
Moon, and just one hill over....if it is more than 20=30 minute <br>
drive my eyes start to glaze over.<br>
<br>
See everyone at the carving demo!<br>
