My husband Darin and I are from Sacramento. We're relatively new to <br/>
LB (about a year), and don't get out of the Valley <br/>
enough to be truly hardcore. But we have a website set up here (which <br/>
is experiencing some technical difficulties, but we'll get <br/>
there):<br/>

<br/>
We got your Natomas Oaks box months ago and have seen your personal stamp in <br/>
places here and there. Good to know you're really out there! You'll have to <br/>
get to the Best of Davis Series one of these days. We've had a lot of 'hits' and <br/>
there's a new one so you can get 5 in a short time.The In-N-Out box is close <br/>
by too! <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to another planting by you! You have real talent in clue <br/>
writing and your micro box at Natomas was really well done! Get out there and <br/>
plant a new one!! We'll be the first to visit it!<br/>
