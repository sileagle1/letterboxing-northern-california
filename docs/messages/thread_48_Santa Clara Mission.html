County: Santa Clara <br/>
Nearest city: Santa Clara<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>

Clues<br/>
Founded in 1777 Santa Clara Mission is the 8th California Mission to <br/>
be built. The prestigious Santa Clara University was founded here in <br/>
1861 at this mission and surrounds it. Santa Clara University was <br/>
the first college in California. <br/>
<br/>
Difficultly Level: Easy, flat<br/>
Bring a compass - can be done without, but it's easier if you have <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the front of Santa Clara Mission. <br/>
<br/>
After visitng the inside come out the front door <br/>
<br/>
Walk across the road to the cross in the traffic circle<br/>
<br/>
Standing in front of the cross, walk 25 degrees toward the museum <br/>
building. This would be in NNE direction<br/>
<br/>
Stop and read the two interpretive signs that face the mission<br/>
<br/>
Turn your back on the signs and Look Left 345 degrees, NNW. See the <br/>
evergreen tree overhanging the lawn at the corner of the building? <br/>
<br/>
Walk to the tree just to the right of that tree<br/>
<br/>
Go around the left of the tree in a clockwise manner, the box is <br/>
wedged in the branches of the tree in the back about shoulder <br/>
height. <br/>
<br/>
PLEASE be careful to wedge this box in the tree very well so that it <br/>
doesn't fall out of the tree and get discovered. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before you set out, please read the waiver of responsibility and <br/>
disclaimer.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I saw that you have several new "Mission" boxes planted - hooray!  I have a 4th grader <br/>
and they are supposed to study California History this year - maybe I can convince <br/>
the family that I'm just supporting her education by visiting some of these.  <br/>

Back on the Survivor topic, it's 18 contestants (3 tribes of 6 each) not 16 - mea culpa!<br/>
