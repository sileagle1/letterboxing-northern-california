snow at lassen, we finally stopped yesterday and only had an hour to<br>
snag some boxes. WE got 6....shoudl have been nore but it was<br>
incredibly WINDY!  and I re-echo DA and crowgirl...it was funny to<br>
read about 100" heat when the windchill felt about zero.  I must saw<br>
those San Jose are very conscientious re-hiders.  <br>
<br>
Now I am all fired up to carve my own porcine box to hide when i go<br>
back later this spring to bag the rest of those porkers.  <br>
<br>
ahppy 2007 to all, and I am up for some February group boxing....or an<br>
april fools day gathering. <br>
