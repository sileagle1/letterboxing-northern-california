                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for all the feedback everyone--Black Cavalier, Doublesaj, Princess Lea. I guess I still want to be a purist, and if the stamp is the same, I'll not count it as a new F. Might have to start that new category, though.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here's a bullet from the LbNA FAQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "A box can be counted as Found more than once if the preceding apply,<br/>
&gt; and its clue, location, and stamp image have all changed since Found the<br/>
&gt; first time."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So according to this, the Judah box wouldn't be a counted as a Find for<br/>
&gt; those that found it at the GRR (DoubleSaj &amp; Old Blue were always the<br/>
&gt; rebels).  But, this begs the question, if the stamp, location &amp; clue has<br/>
&gt; changed, what's left to make it the same box?  I guess the log book &amp;<br/>
&gt; physical box could be the same, but if it's a new stamp, I'd assume<br/>
&gt; there'd be a new log book.  So, I don't see how all these things could<br/>
&gt; change &amp; still be somehow considered the same box.  I guess if a box had<br/>
&gt; been vandalized &amp; the stamp was lost, but the book was still there, then<br/>
&gt; the box could be moved to a better hiding spot &amp; a new stamp carved.<br/>
&gt; The "new" box would still have some continuity with the original box,<br/>
&gt; but count as a new find.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNCA] newly replanted Old Sac box &amp; a question<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Today I finally replanted the last of my Old Sac boxes that were<br/>
&gt; pulled--Pony Express Postmark.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I have a question: I think I deleted the post, but did Doublesaj say<br/>
&gt; that since their Judah box is now in a whole new county, if you find it<br/>
&gt; you can count the F? I think I'm becoming a real purist when it comes to<br/>
&gt; F count. It's the same box, you've already found it. Maybe there needs<br/>
&gt; to be an L count for new locations. What IS the protocol?<br/>
