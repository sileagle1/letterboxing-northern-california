<br>
If anyone knows Toucan personally, could you let that bird know that I'd like a little input on the Mt. Tallac summit box? I sent an email through the LbNA site, but haven't received a reply. I hiked that mountain last Thursday, and a smart friend and I searched and searched on the summit to no avail. A storm was coming, so I had to abandon my search (didn't want to get caught up top if there was any lightning), but I don't think more time would have made a difference. I want to think that the referred to boulder fell off the mountain this past winter, that's how much trouble I had finding it! Did find the other box, though. So fun to go do a big trek like that and get boxes to boot. Thanks for planting, Toucan, and help!!!<br>

<br>
I'm not sure why I didn't receive your prior message. <br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for visiting the Tallac boxes!  I'm happy to<br>
hear the lower box is still safe and in-place.  Thank<br>
you for the report on that!<br>
<br>
The upper box is a bit hard to describe and I haven't<br>
been there since planting it up there last year.  Did<br>
you climb up to the highest point you could go at the<br>
summit?  Once there on the north most end there is a<br>
hole near the tallest rock - just before the edge<br>
slants off.  The opening of the hole faces strait up -<br>
so the sun would shine in at high-noon.  My biggest<br>
fear would be that when the snow melted, the letterbox<br>
could have floated up and out of there.  However, it<br>
was covered by small rocks and twigs so hopefully it's<br>
still there.  <br>
<br>
I've moved out of the Bay Area (temporarily for a<br>
couple of years), but hope to come back this fall for<br>
a trek to the top of Tallac and can check on it then. <br>
I'm now living in Chicago where sadly to report there<br>
isn't much letterboxing going on.<br>
<br>
Cheers Northern Californians!<br>
