                    <div class="plaintext-content">I FINALLY got up to replant this box today, and it is in a much better <br/>
spot than before - cross your fingers it doesn't go missing again.  <br/>
Here's the weird story: I was hunting around in the vicinity for a good <br/>
hiding spot and saw a stump that looked like a likely candidate.  So, I <br/>
look inside ...... and there's already a box in there!  Well, I figured <br/>
maybe it's a geocache or something, but as far as I can tell it really <br/>
was a letterbox, planted in May 2004. There was a store bought stamp of <br/>
a compass rose, an ink pad, a pen and some index cards stapled <br/>
together.  There was a note from the planter saying to stamp in, but no <br/>
trail name or way to contact them.  There were only a couple of people <br/>
who had found the box, and no one had a personal stamp.  One entry <br/>
indicated that they had completed the "Waypoint Pamela Mission" and it <br/>
was signed by the person using their military designation - does this <br/>
stuff sound familiar to anyone?  Is there yet ANOTHER hobby out there <br/>
similar to ours?  Or did I stumble across some super secret military <br/>
war games (pretty low tech if so)?   Anyway, I stamped in and will <br/>
include the means to find it as a bonus box from Twisted Candles once I <br/>
get the clues revised.<br/>
<br/>
Found Fairy Ring, Chabot Alien and Sqwigly Alien along the way, and <br/>
also got to watch a dog roll around in horse poop (his master said it <br/>
was the dog's favorite thing to do).  Oh the adventures you can have <br/>
out on the trails!<br/>
