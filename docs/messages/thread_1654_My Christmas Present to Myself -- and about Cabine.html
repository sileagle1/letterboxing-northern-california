we know what to treat ourselves to, right?<br/>
<br/>
I've been eying the huge volumes of illustrations from the old<br/>
cabinets of curiosities -- usually engravings done in the 17th and<br/>
18th centuries. I think there are 3 books of cabinet illustrations on<br/>
the market now. They are very expensive -- up to $100 each -- due to<br/>
their many large format and every page printed in color.<br/>
<br/>
I had a discount coupon at a bookstore nearby, and yesterday, I<br/>
decided to use it. When I walked into the store, I immediately spotted<br/>
one of those expensive volumes -- on sale for $55. My coupon brought<br/>
that price down by $13 more, and the book begged me to take it home.<br/>
It contains the collection of color plates from the curiosity cabinet<br/>
of Albertus Seba (Dutch) that were made from 1734 - 1765. It has 543<br/>
10" x 15" pages and probably weighs about 12 pounds or so.<br/>
<br/>
Since my set of Cabinet of Curiosities letterboxes is sort of a master<br/>
project or "letterboxing thesis", the book will be a great resource.<br/>
Seba's Cabinet, however, was limited to natural history (including<br/>
freaks &amp; monsters), whereas my collection can also include cultural,<br/>
historical, religious, and artistic artifacts as well -- like many<br/>
other cabinets from the past. <br/>
<br/>
The early cabinets were an attempt to build a diverse collection of<br/>
objects, that when seen together, represented the world in a<br/>
microcosm. Objects were arranged so that viewers might see connections<br/>
between them and learn about the cosmos.  <br/>
