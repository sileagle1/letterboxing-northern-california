until yesterday. I got over to Huckleberry Preserve in the Oakland<br/>
Hills and found two of Blackbird's stamps. I messaged Blackbird, and<br/>
to let everyone know, Box #1 which had been attempted on 1/3 and not<br/>
found was nearby and I placed it back according to the clue, Box #2 of<br/>
the Huckleberry series seems to be missing. Box #3 was in place. I<br/>
missed Box #4 and the other boxes along the way and will try to go<br/>
back sometime. Everything was nice and green and the air was clear and<br/>
fresh. It was a great day for a hike.<br/>
<br/>
As for carving, I have a plan...and it is big! It may take a few<br/>
months, maybe more, but I think it will be good. ; )<br/>
<br/>
Take care everyone,<br/>
