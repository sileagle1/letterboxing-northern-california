I've considered a letterbox where you'd start in one spot, then figure out<br>
where you'd end up after a certain square dance call -- as your next step,<br>
and so on...<br>
<br>
But it's way too arcane, isn't it? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have another Cabinet of Curiosities box ready & waiting, but I need to<br>
take it to its hosting store --- and then that takes a sales pitch to the<br>
potential host, plus a lot of explanation about letterboxing. Maybe I'll<br>
just send them to Bay Area Back Roads & let lisascenic tell it all in<br>
convenient video form.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
BTW, folks, I've just formed my new dance group for my nonstandard square<br>
dance pieces. It's called the Not-So-Square Dance Ensemble, and after over 8<br>
weeks of phone calls, the City of SF gave me the free use of a dance studio<br>
in exchange for performing our pieces for the City in the future. We just<br>
started work on a piece called, "Volcanic" - it uses fast Cape Breton-style<br>
folk violin music played by Natalie MacMaster. It's a very energetic piece,<br>
but doesn't stray too radically far from what you'd consider square dance -<br>
except we're changing the standardized styling of almost all the calls, and<br>
adding a brief Scottish folk jig in the middle.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
This is a big challenge for square dancers - they're not used to moving<br>
without a caller.<br>
