Here is a message that we received on one of our most recent plants. <br/>
I answered back thanking him for his understanding and I appologized <br/>
for causing a flap. Anyone going to Auburn? Want to take a magnet <br/>
and some glue?<br/>

Hello.  I am Officer Ed Leighton with the Auburn Police Department.  <br/>
Your Altoids tin underneath the US mailbox was discovered by a City <br/>
employee when the empoyee dropped some mail into the empty box.  One <br/>
more magnet would have done the trick I think.  After calling out <br/>
the bomb squad to determine the device safe or not, I wrote an <br/>
incident report to document my findings.  I think that this kind of <br/>
activity is indeed great fun and an awesome alternative for people <br/>
to have fun, but in the future, maybe let local law enforcement know <br/>
so if discovered valuable resources are not used to investigate.  I <br/>
have placed the tin back underneath the mailbox.  Continue to enjoy <br/>
and we all here hope you come back to Auburn. <br/>

Perhaps simply re-locating the letterbox to a different site would be<br/>
a good idea? If Officer Leighton changes beats or retires, your box<br/>
will probably go through the exact same thing later.<br/>

When we posted this it wasn't to solicit ideas on how to hide or where to hide letterboxes, although we are always open to suggestions. We posted this so that letterboxers can see that there are some understanding officials out there. Obviously there were no laws broken or officer Ed would have not replaced the letterbox. I do think it interesting that he thought one more magnet would have been better. <br/>
