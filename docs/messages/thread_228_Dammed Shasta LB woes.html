I guess this hobby is getting TOO popular (never thought I'd ever <br/>
say that in a million years!!!).  Unfortunately vandals, treasure <br/>
hunters or stamp poachers have absconded with this tiny little <br/>
stamp.  The letterbox is still there but the stamp was replaced with <br/>
chunks of 'blue glass'?  As we will not be able to visit this area <br/>
again for a LONG time this box will linger without a stamp for a <br/>
long while, perhaps forever.  If some kind soul visiting the area <br/>
would like to take their hand at carving a replacement stamp during <br/>
their visit (using the image of the original stamp in the logbook) <br/>
we would greatly appreciate it.  Otherwise, there's one less <br/>
letterbox available to folks in the Shasta Lake area (near Redding).<br/>
