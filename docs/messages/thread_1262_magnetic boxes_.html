                    <div class="plaintext-content">As I mentioned in the email I just sent, my wife is going to be out of<br>
town, so I thought I might get some boxing in.  I also thought it might<br>
give me a chance to plant the childrens' boxes that I made such a big<br>
deal about a few months ago.  The initial ones I'd planned to be<br>
magnetic, so I'm curious how people have make them.<br>
 <br>
I've see artTrekker's magnetic boxes, using either epoxy or duct tape.<br>
But it sounds like neither have lasted a long time.  I was thinking of<br>
using an Altoids tin, & putting the magnet on the inside.  That way the<br>
magent wouldn't have to be glued or taped the to box, & hopefully, the<br>
magnetic force outside the box would still be enough to attach it.<br>
 <br>
Any other ideas?<br>

  <br>
  See if you can get ahold of some power magnets. These babies<br>
  are small and STRONG!!!! I found some in Santa Fe at Hobby Lobby,<br>
  wonder if Michaels has them. I've been experimenting with Gorilla<br>
  glue, which says it's weatherproof and permanent. It seems pretty<br>
  strong. Also in Santa Fe, I found the best magnetic key case I've seen.<br>
  It actually has a little room for logbook and stamp. It is MasterLock<br>
  item# 206D. (You need to make sure it is that one, because I think<br>
  MasterLock also makes the ones that have a key-shaped space inside,<br>
  which is NG for boxing.) The interior space is almost 3" by almost 1 3/4"<br>
  by 3/8"+ deep.<br>
  <br>
  Tin Tin at Exploratorium is just great! You might want to skip the two<br>
  outdoor ones, though.<br>
  <br>
  Dorks, I think the 'zine idea is cool! I'm gonna want one, even if I can't<br>
  make it.<br>
