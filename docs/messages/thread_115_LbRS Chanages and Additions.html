                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to let everyone know about the upgrade done last night to the Letterbox Rating System (LbRS).  The <br>
following things have been added/changed in response to the feedback I've gotten.<br>
<br>
Due to the overwhelming requests, Pet friendly has been returned to Dog friendly as this more accurately covers what <br>
we are looking for here. I mean, no one's ever complained about a pet cat running down the trail and jumping up on <br>
someone slobbering all over them. Nor has anyone complained about someone's pet lizard barreling down the trail, <br>
though, I'll tell you what, if I saw someone's pet Iguana barreling down the trail at me, I'd be hard pressed to not <br>
stand there in shock, completely amazed. Besides, the signs we see at a park show a Dog on a leash, not a cat or a <br>
lizard.<br>
<br>
Also, due to overwhelming requests for these additions, I've added the following additional ratings. P for Parking <br>
Fees, E for Special Equipment and TED for Total Estimated Distance.  The new P and E ratings are now placed at the end <br>
of the current string and the TED is combined into the current T or Trail rating to give a combined score.  The TED <br>
ratings are:<br>
<br>
0 = Unknown, 1 = 0 to 1/4 mile, 2 = 1/4 to 1/2 mile, 3 = 1/2 to 1 mile, 4 = 1 to 2 miles, 5 = Over 2 miles <br>
<br>
And the new ratings would look like this:  'T2-2' which would mean an Easy trail with a Total Estimated Distance of <br>
between 1/4 to 1/2 mile.<br>
<br>
Parking fees is a simple Yes/No question. If the spot you start someone out from requires them to pay parking should <br>
the park there, then a yes is a good idea.<br>
<br>
Special equipment is as well also. If any special equipment is required, other than the normal day hike items, then <br>
select Yes.<br>
<br>
Feel free to keep your current ratings if you want to, the old style will not break the decoder, it decodes both new <br>
and old formats as well.  If you want to update your current ratings on your letterboxes, feel free to do so.<br>
<br>
As far the request to include the rating for "NDQ" (Nearest Dairy Queen) and "NBH" (Nearest Brew House), I'm sorry, <br>
but I believe that extra curricular activities are something for each person to experience on their own, in their own <br>
way! ;-)<br>
