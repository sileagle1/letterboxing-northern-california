EVERYONE! <br/>
<br/>
What a great day!  We've never seen so much delicious food (there must have been tons leftover!), the boxes were spectacular (Dem XX Men's "BASS Akwards" gets our vote for cleverest plant!) and the weather couldn't have been better!<br/>
<br/>
I hope the Grinches got to enjoy themselves--they were awfully busy making sure everyone was fed and happy. <br/>
<br/>
Hunter, you should hire yourself out to do 'zines for every 'boxing event! It was so helpful (and entertaining!) to have all the clues and info in one "packet".<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry we had to leave so early but for Old Blue, his soccer games are a priority.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for making BASS a wonderful success!<br/>
