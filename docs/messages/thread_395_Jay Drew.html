Jay is also a member of this mailing list as he does like to know what's going on around <br>
here.  I *almost* got to meet him during the summer, but on the only weekend he was in <br>
California, I just happened to be in Connecticut where he now resides.  D'oh!<br>
<br>
Jay, do you have any words for your legions of adoring fans?<br>
