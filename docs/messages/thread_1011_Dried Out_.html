                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks!  We faired pretty well...and took several walks in the downtown Petaluma area where we could during the storms.  The river was very high and overflowing in spots.  There were parts of town that were indeed flooded and are just beginning to dry out.  I was worried about the Sweet Dreams LB series, so checked out the boxes that potentially could have had trouble--all okay.  Shollenberger has not yet been replaced as I still have to recarve the missing one and find new hiding spots.  Riverwalk (Balshaw) is just fine.<br/>
