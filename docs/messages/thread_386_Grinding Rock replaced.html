My apologies to those of you who have made this trek and found the <br/>
box AWOL. It was a gorgeous, cold December morning, the perfect time <br/>
to rehide this box. There wasn't another soul in sight. Enjoy! Funhog<br/>

We were among those who discovered this lovely place, thanks to your <br/>
box.  It was missing when we got there, which was a disappointment, <br/>
true.  But the day, the location, the search were wonderful.  We <br/>
will look forward to returning in search of the newly replaced <br/>
letterbox.  Thanks.<br/>

I visited Grinding Rock BL (Before Letterboxing) It is a park that <br/>
actually has a Nancy Drew connection! There is a Dana Girls book <br/>
called the Sierra Gold Mystery, which takes place in the gold country <br/>
around Grinding Rock State Park and they actually go to Grinding <br/>
Rock. So I visited the area with other rabid Nancy Drew (and other <br/>
Girls Series) fans several years ago!<br/>
Can't wait to go back for the letterbox.<br/>
