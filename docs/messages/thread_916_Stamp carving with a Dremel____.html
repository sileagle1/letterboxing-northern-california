I've had my Dremel for ages, and have been perplexed by all the bits <br>
and accesories. I recently got it out in preparation to cut through a <br>
great ornamental gourd to make a lidded container. The Dremel site has <br>
a number of projects that you might want to look at, so that you get <br>
some use out of it.<br>
<br>
There MUST be some way to use it to help camoflage boxes! (as <br>
birdhouses, maybe...)<br>

Actually, I would LOVE the opportunity to watch someone carve with <br>
an Xacto knife. I can manage it somewhat, but there's got to be <br>
an 'approach' to working with it that is much more orderly and <br>
precise.<br>
<br>
What if 3 people simultaneously carved the same image using the 3 <br>
different tools as a Winter Gathering demo? I think that'd be very <br>
interesting.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd like to be comfortable with using any or all of the <br>
3 methods, depending on the look I want to achieve. (I try to tell <br>
myself that Speedball gouges add a rustic flavor ... ha ha ha).<br>

This would be awesome!  I've only carved the one stamp (my personal)<br>
thus far and used the Speedball cutters.  Looking at some of the other<br>
stamps in the boxes we've found and their logbooks I can tell we're<br>
certainly missing out on something.  I mean, I know more practice will<br>
take me a long way, but seeing all three techniques used on the same<br>
image would be AWESOME!!<br>
