Of course  it need not be so tongue-in-cheek: references to actually <br/>

*chuckle*  Well, just so long as they're tolerated I might hide a <br/>

Hi BugZ, welcome back from Louisianna, hope you had a not to horrible <br/>
airport experience.  <br/>
<br/>
the wine Country Challenge was something I initiated after theJuly gathering <br/>
in Golden Gate Park.  a very informal attempt to get more boxes planted in <br/>
Sonoma COunty (so selfish of me really so I would not have to drive so far to <br/>
find boxes!)  At the GGG there was a challenge to play off the theme "I left my <br/>
Heart in SF"  Thus, Lost my dart, flower cart, stolen tart boxes in the park. <br/>
<br/>
 I got to thinking I cold start a similar thiing up north, playing off the whole wine <br/>
country tourism stuff (which gets really old if you live here actually).  Thus the <br/>
boxes Twine Country, Wino Country, Brine Country and now Gray Pine <br/>
Country.    The Drew Clan already had a Wine Country Series, and Lea has <br/>
done a box as well as PAul in SF (Sleepy Bacchus).  Of course it does not <br/>
have to rhyme, or even be wine related.  <br/>
<br/>
There was also a suggestion by me to get some Dartmoor style boxes planted <br/>
at a british pub here and I started the ball rolling wiht Rooster Taurus and <br/>
Deers of West Dartmoor.  <br/>
<br/>
So that is the history, and if you are interested please add a box!  <br/>
<br/>
Cheers, <br/>
Mim<br/>

Thanks so much for the info.  So far - Sonoma County boxing is our favorite!  So we will be planting there soon...after hitting the Bodega Bay/Occidental boxes (missed Rooster Taurus - but WILL go back!) we zoomed down to Glen Ellen to catch the winery boxes and then Sugar Loaf Ridge - the winery was closed for the holiday and we ran out of daylight for SLR park.  Guess where we will be headed as soon as we get a dry day???? <br/>
<br/>
Airports were a piece of cake for us!  We had some good karma going.  Hope you had a great holiday!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, BugZ<br/>
