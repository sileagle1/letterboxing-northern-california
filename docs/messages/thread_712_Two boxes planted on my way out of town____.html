the Aquatic Park in Berkeley.  They are both Aquatic Birds.<br>
<br>
The clues are really lame, because I was in a rush to get this done <br>
before I left town.  Let's just hope that I didn't foul up my <br>
instructions.<br>
<br>
And speaking of which, I'm planning on planting Aquatic Birds in other <br>
locations, so I was unsure of how to deal with the "series" issue.  <br>
Can someone tell me if I listed these in a way that makes sense?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
