                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well my family and I finally made it to sunny, beautiful Mendocino <br>
county.  We really were blessed with the most amazing weather....warm, <br>
bright and no wind, not even enough to fly the king kong kite I bought <br>
at the kite store in Old Sac where the letterbox was hidden.  But <br>
great weather for boxing and gettign sunburned!  WE found boxes 1, 2, <br>
4 and 5 of St Patrick.  Here is hoping that box 3 eluded us craftily <br>
and that it is not missing for real.  Great, great series and worth <br>
the trip.<br>
<br>
Those were the only boxes we got, my family had lots of other things <br>
on the agenda (wineries, pygmy forest, bike riding, carniverous <br>
plants, beachcombing) so I did not push the boxing angle.  I was <br>
hoping to go to the Botanical Gardens but not enough time. SO much to <br>
do , so little tine.  <br>
<br>
I planted Candied Loquat (PT form GRR) as "Shipwreck of the frolic" so <br>
if any of you got that at the event, this is the exact same stamp...I <br>
did the clues ala "a series of unfortunate event" hopefully they seem <br>
funny and not terrible depressing.  <br>
<br>
Looking foward to hearing of others sdventures, <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On the way home from a daytrip to my cabin near Mt Lassen, I stopped off<br>
to get Funhog Lake Plateau.  I wandered around this arid pock-marked,<br>
rocks-strewn landscape for an hour.  If you take away the grass, trees &<br>
air, it'd be just like the moon.  I was a bit worried since the<br>
pock-marks were actually cattle hoofprints, so I was expecting a herd to<br>
show up at any minute & chase me down.  At one point in the clues, I was<br>
unsure which way to go & I of course picked the wrong way.  I finally<br>
tried the other way & got to the hiding spot pretty easily.  & lo &<br>
behold, the hiding spot was one I had already walked past at least twice<br>
because I was reading the clues a little too literally.  Be sure to<br>
bring water with you if you attempt this one during the summer.<br>

Day boxhunt.  Boy what a beautiful city and a beautiful day!  I am glad <br>
to report we found every box we looked for and in great condition.  <br>
However, the worry of Memorial Day traffic getting back to Fairfield <br>
made us cut our hunt short.<br>
<br>
(We started the weekend boxing on Sunday by finding "Milk Town" (aT, <br>
your carving will never cease to amaze me!) and a quick jaunt to Winters <br>
to get "Yolo Oak".  Now /that/ road needs help!)<br>
<br>
American Graffiti was a great series, took us all over town!  "Debbie" <br>
ran us into some "Ranger Danger" (as BugZ stated), but we were able to <br>
bluff our way through it.  Being near the movie sites was thrilling.  <br>
But, alas, no drag racing on Frates.<br>
"Riverwalk" took us past a great smelling restaurant with lots of people <br>
waiting for a seat!  Even though we had just had lunch elsewhere, I <br>
think I could've eaten again there!  YUM!  We loved the bridge!<br>
"You & Me" was a short hike, climb, calf burning, ankle twisting quest <br>
(THANKS Wascally Wabbit! *wink*).  AND we did actually see one deer run <br>
away from our noisy descent!  But be careful of the plant that send <br>
barbs into your socks and ankles!  We all spent some time doing sock <br>
maintenance.  :)<br>
"Shollenberger Park" proved to be most amazing!  The birds, the <br>
scenery....I couldn't believe this area existed near the city!  The <br>
wildlife abounded, the goslings were so cute!  We found the two boxes <br>
(*wink* + the bonus!!).  However, the elderly strollers walked faster <br>
than my hips would let me and they lapped me.<br>
We will have to venture for the Dream Series and go back for the <br>
remaining Simpson, "Maggie", another day.<br>
Thank you all for such great boxes and sites in Petaluma!  Without you <br>
guys I'm sure we'd never travel to the places we have since we started <br>
boxing!  Can't wait till the Gabbering!<br>
ps-aT, did you find your personal stamp yet?  I do hope you find it! ~Mo<br>
