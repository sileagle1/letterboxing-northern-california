Runway - that is just pig!<br>
<br>
I am almost ready for the next box in my Lunar New Year series - Pig is about 3/4 carved <br>
and I already have a spot picked out.  Looks like it doesn't get started until 2/18 this year <br>
though - seems a little later than usual.  Hmmm, wonder how I can get *my* stamp to <br>
smell like pork.....  No wait, that will attract unwanted visitors, like vultures or something.<br>
<br>
I have been on a carving jag the past couple of days.  I finished and replanted Sushi House <br>
and Survivor: The Amazon #3 (thought #4 might be missing too, but I did find it alive and <br>
well).  Got a stamp ready for my Girl Scout trip this weekend, and have gotten a few ready <br>
for the April Fools gathering too.  It sure is fun having free time on my hands with no <br>
school work or job responsibilities!!<br>
