                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all of you who have placed boxes for us to find.  We have an <br>
advantage in that we are retired and eager to get out and hike, solve <br>
clues, and explore new places.  Plus we can go during the week when <br>
those of you with jobs and children at home might not be so free.<br>
<br>
As we plan our next road trip/ letterboxing vacation, we are again <br>
amazed at how many people have created letterboxes in our beautiful <br>
state for all of us to seek and find.  Thank you!!!<br>
<br>
See you on the trails.<br>
