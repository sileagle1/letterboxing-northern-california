                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, Old Blue and I had the outstanding experience of going out <br>
on a hog hunt in Red Bluff, CA. Happy to report 15 beautiful and <br>
amazing hogs bagged (and released, of course) plus an additional 2 <br>
and a little hitchhiker to boot! The kicker was that we met, on the <br>
way out, another couple just going in for a hunt of their own--<br>
Mysterygal and Boatman! So COOL!! (An additional box to be listed <br>
soon. . .)<br>
<br>
This was a 2-day venture as the 102* heat forced us in on Thursday to <br>
return Friday morning with temps starting out about 25* cooler. Took <br>
us 3+ hours to get them all each being found with no trouble. (Great <br>
clues, Don & Gwen!) What a wonderful tribute to our vernerable <br>
letterboxer friend, Funhog.<br>
<br>
Continued north and found 2 actual Funhog boxes (among others) at Mt. <br>
Shasta and So. Oregon. Was surprised to see so few had stamped in <br>
before us==5 and 6 respectfully and we were the first to stamp in <br>
this year! Get out there and find these wonderful plants by That <br>
Great Hog.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday we went up to Red Bluff--seven hours of driving, and about<br>
four of boxing.  Wow.  As soon as we got up there, the Boxdar was<br>
turned on and we could find some of them without really needing to<br>
even read the clues.  It also being a bit desolate and windswept,<br>
that's how I imagine Dartmoor must be.  We still ran out of daylight,<br>
so we didn't get ALL of the boxes up there. If you haven't gone yet,<br>
you should go NOW, when it's cold and windy.  It was amusing reading<br>
people's comments about the sun and heat and brambles, and I was<br>
actually a little cold. It was a marvelous day, and great fun was had<br>
by all.  dorks anonymous of dem xx men<br>
