The criteria for a letterbox is pretty simple, it contains a logbook <br>
you can put your image into and a stamp that you can stamp into your <br>
personal logbook.<br>

Okay, not trying to get technical... but what about boxes that only <br>
have one or the other... stamp but no logbook or logbook but no stamp?<br>

Same answer.<br>
Except in those cases you have the opportunity to do a little <br>
maintenance.<br>
