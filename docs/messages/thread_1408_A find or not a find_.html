The criteria for a letterbox is pretty simple, it contains a logbook <br/>
you can put your image into and a stamp that you can stamp into your <br/>
personal logbook.<br/>

family runs across a lost/destroyed box we still write in our logbooks<br/>
of the experience and certainly contact the owner, but we do not report<br/>
it as a find.  <br/>

Same answer.<br/>
Except in those cases you have the opportunity to do a little <br/>
maintenance.<br/>
