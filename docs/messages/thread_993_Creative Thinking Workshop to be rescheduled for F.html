                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry, folks, but I need to reschedule... it turns out that work is <br>
sending me to Phoenix that week... plus, January is a bit heavy duty <br>
with work projects, and I may have to fly to Utica, NY as my very <br>
dear 'adopted mom' from my extended family is extremely ill.<br>
<br>
I'm considering the middle of February instead. How about SATURDAY, <br>
FEB. 18th? I hope that works for most of you.<br>
<br>
I have been pulling together some materials for the class, and I'm <br>
very excited about the workshop. I'll get you thinking! <br>
<br>
Also, last week I got together with Da Kool Kats who came into SF -- <br>
we arranged to meet and exchange at the folk art store that hosts 'Day <br>
of the Dead'. We had a great little visit, then the Kats went on a <br>
blitzkreig, nabbing several of my boxes, and one other as well for a <br>
total of 7! They were FFs for my tiny 'If All Else Fails' box, which <br>
has been lonely for over 3 weeks waiting for RedSF, Princess Lea, or <br>
Anna & the kids.<br>
<br>
I just carved a stamp for an event in NY called, 'Desperately Seeking <br>
Sun', that I'm sending to the event organizer as part of a <br>
Letterboxing Bingo game. (Object is to find event boxes that <br>
correspond to a big bingo card... get a line stamped in, and win). The <br>
stamp image is a woman lying on a beach under a parasol, reading. <br>
<br>
Welcome back, Mim! The trip sounds like it was wonderful! Lisascenic <br>
and Robb, still want a day in Oakland...<br>

Feb 18th is the Saturday of the President's Day Weekend - I was <br>
planning on going on the snow trip with Sleepy Cat's Girl Scouts troop <br>
that weekend, and I imagine other people may have other long-weekend <br>
conflicts.  I seem to remember that the 28th of January was okay for <br>
some folks - are you already scheduled that day Paul?<br>
<br>
In the event that we can't find a good date for a few months, do people <br>
who are still available January 14th still want to try and do something <br>
that day?  Can't imagine that it will be nice weather, but if the <br>
forecast looks good maybe we can do some gang boxing.<br>
