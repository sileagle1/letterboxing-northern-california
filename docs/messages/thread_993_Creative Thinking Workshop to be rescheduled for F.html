Also, last week I got together with Da Kool Kats who came into SF -- <br/>
we arranged to meet and exchange at the folk art store that hosts 'Day <br/>
of the Dead'. We had a great little visit, then the Kats went on a <br/>
blitzkreig, nabbing several of my boxes, and one other as well for a <br/>
total of 7! They were FFs for my tiny 'If All Else Fails' box, which <br/>
has been lonely for over 3 weeks waiting for RedSF, Princess Lea, or <br/>
Anna &amp; the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I just carved a stamp for an event in NY called, 'Desperately Seeking <br/>
Sun', that I'm sending to the event organizer as part of a <br/>
Letterboxing Bingo game. (Object is to find event boxes that <br/>
correspond to a big bingo card... get a line stamped in, and win). The <br/>
stamp image is a woman lying on a beach under a parasol, reading. <br/>

In the event that we can't find a good date for a few months, do people <br/>
