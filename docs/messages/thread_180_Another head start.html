several dozen LB hunts that sounded intriguing near places we would be <br/>
staying (Morris COunty, NJ, Bucks County. PA, Cape May, Baltimore).  I <br/>
was only able to go on 5 hunts due to lack of time (Quite frustrating <br/>
to know they are out there but you can't get away to go looking!)<br/>
<br/>
I was 1 for 5!  Quite dispiriting.  There had been alot of rain and <br/>
flooding so some boxes were quite literally swept away and on one <br/>
urban hunt a homeless person was sleeping precisely were the box <br/>
should of been.  And I am now much better at id-ing poison ivy...<br/>
fortunately did not break out in itching.  <br/>
<br/>
I am happy to back here and realize how lucky we are to have 6 month <br/>
sof dry weather a year for LBing!<br/>

This box will be placed on 7/31/04 for the NCal LB gathering at Golden <br/>
Gate Park. What follows are clues that will get you to the starting <br/>
point for this hunt. The final precise directions will be given at the <br/>
gathering. See you there!<br/>
