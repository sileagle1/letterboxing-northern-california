great clues: the two keys and having to decipher the code, the <br>

HAving lost a few boxes now myself, I know it very disappointing.  Not <br>
knowing what became of it: vandlas, animals, random acts of natural <br>
forces is quite distressing.  Maybe some Ivy League researcher can <br>
apply for a grant and investigate this topic more thoroughly so <br>
letterboxers   can  design better boxes, or at least thwart the forces <br>
of chaos from making off with them.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, this new of the MIA Atlantis box came on the day when I was going to take my niece who's visiting from NY to find it. I was going to implement a great idea from Princess Lea and keep the journal separate and dry in a different box nearby.<br>
<br>
I can't say that I'm disappointed or saddened (except that Scott didn't get the reward for his hunt).<br>
<br>
I  now think of letterboxes as being ephemeral (like flowers, sunsets, and cloud patterns) and they pass with time. For the Temple of Neptune box, it's VERY appropriate. According to the legend and lore, the box is probably not missing at all, and has just moved into the same psychic dimension that Tlamco still exists in [GRIN].<br>
<br>
I created a rare underwater letterbox (possibly the first), and that makes me extremely pleased. PLUS, I'm sure I surprised ALL of you who found it by placing it not in a lake, pond or ocean, but in (of all things) a WATERFALL!<br>
<br>
It will not be replaced, nor will Atlantis.<br>
<br>
However, folks, please remember that there are other temples of Tlamco here, and the same time traveler that placed the letterbox at the Temple of Neptune may strike again at a different temple location.<br>

What the heck?  YOU were the Postmaster General of Tlamco?!  Well, <br>
that certainly explains a few things....<br>
