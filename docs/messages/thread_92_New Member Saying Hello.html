                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi -<br/>
As a new (and enthusiastic) member, I thought I'd post a greeting, <br/>
rather than wait quietly on the sidelines. I guess I'm still a LbNCA <br/>
virgin, but my first failed attempt at a find may be one of Princess <br/>
Lea's possible MIA letterboxes :-(  Not discouraged, I may be ready <br/>
to plant my first box this weekend. Planting before finding, is that <br/>
kosher? Will I still be a virgin?<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I'll be in Long Beach next weekend, getting a friend <br/>
sucked into the hunt for letterboxes down there. (They have more <br/>
boxes than SF does)!<br/>
<br/>
Since I live smack in the center of San Francisco, I'm hoping to <br/>
create more urban letterbox action. I'm noted for my creative <br/>
imagination, so fasten your seat belts. I'm a multimedia producer by <br/>
profession, so I'm thinking about possible ways to expand the <br/>
letterbox experience through media, i.e. sound, for example. Still <br/>
cogitating on that...<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'll look to you folks when I need help or advice based <br/>
on experience.<br/>
<br/>
So, Happy Letterboxing, folks!<br/>
Paul G.  a.k.a.  Paul in SF <br/>

Oh, Goody!! Another new letterboxer fairly close by! So you want to plant <br/>
urban, huh? Can I put a vote in to head in an easterly direction so it's closer <br/>
to where we might hunt? Just a suggestion. . .<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!!<br/>

Does an attempt at planting in Oakland/Berkeley help? I don't own a <br/>
car (I'm in the City CarShare program), so eastward to me is like <br/>
China was to Marco Polo -- rich, but distant. <br/>

Hey, it really doesn't matter. If you plant them, we will come! Oakland and <br/>
Berkeley, SF, anywhere. We've gotten all the SF boxes so far (and I just heard <br/>
The Black Bird is missing--glad we got that one a couple of months ago) and <br/>
it's always a treat when we find there's more to hunt. <br/>
<br/>
If you haven't gotten Where the Buffalo Roam, The Message in the Haunted <br/>
Mansion and Look at that Big Rock (the last only if you're in excellent shape!!) I <br/>
encourage you to do so when you can. Great locations and wonderful stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing what you plant on the "What's New" list soon!!<br/>

Paul,<br/>
And do please plant some boxes for us SoCal letterboxers. Long Beach <br/>
is a hotbed of CA letterboxing, but if you go inland a few miles <br/>
you'll find that the Pasadena area has a great collection of boxes as <br/>
well.<br/>
