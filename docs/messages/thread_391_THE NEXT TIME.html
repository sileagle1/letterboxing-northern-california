the next time you see a post from me it will be under our Trail name <br/>
which is BOOTZOO CREW.  AT the time I signed up for yahoo I picked <br/>
the Deiselluver name.  Not knowing I could get a new account and <br/>
delete the other one and use my  actual name.   So I will be doing <br/>
that in the next few minutes.  While out on the trail we have been <br/>
stamping our carved stamp and our BOOTZOO CREW stamp directly <br/>
underneath .  This is our Geo name and our PLB name also and I want <br/>
to use in the forums as well.  Deiselluver was just way to confusing <br/>
for most.  So remember when you see a post from the BOOTZOO CREW it <br/>
is just us.  Thanks for bearing with me.  Michelle (BOOTZOO CREW)<br/>
