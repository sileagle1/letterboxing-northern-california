Hello,I'm just wondering if anyone knows what happened to Aahz? I've found many of his boxes and quite a few of them are in need of some TLC. I've tried emailing him through the LB sites as well as his personal email. I even tried his daughter Zairabear. He has not logged onto AQ since October of 2006.It seems that he was so dedicated for so long that I can't imagine completely turning my back on something. I guess lives change.If the boxes seem to be abondened, is there a way to adopt them and change the update information or the status of the box? Some of the boxes are missing now and it would be nice if the pages stated that.<br/>
I went through Aahz's and Zairabear's logbooks and this is what I came up with:In excellent condition: Silverback (I would be willing to adopt/maintain if Lock Wench would like me to).These boxes need to be retired due to time limits, being listed as unavailable, unknown, etc.1) Dogberry's School of Fencing2) The Gilroy Vampire3) Mallrats-Gus Guzzler4) Mallrats-Cop Shop5) GRRRRRRR-Black Bear Diner6) Woodsmen of the WorldIf I am wrong about these, please chime in.These boxes are probably missing and will need to be retired, but should be checked on first by someone who has already found them, just to make sure (this is based on several people reporting the boxes as Attempted). Any takers?7) Rod Kelley Knights8) Haagen Dazs9) Burgers10) 21 Mile House (I'll double check this one since I was the last finder :(--I can also adopt this one if it is around)These boxes may or may not be around. They don't have so many attempts. They might very well just be in need of some of TLC.11) Rugrats: Tommy 12) Gilroy's Old City Hall 13) The Cursed Park Is anyone willing to check on #s 11, 12, and/or 13?14) Charles Martinet15) Jack and the Beanstalk16) Gilroy Hitchhiker Hostel17) Morgan Hill Letterbox I can check on #s 14, 15, 16, and 17. I can also adopt these if they are still around.I hope I am not overstepping my bounds here. I don't really know why the disappearance of a planter is bugging me so much. However, I guess I would just like to see the boxes properly maintained and accounted for.SJ Honey Bunny<br/>
