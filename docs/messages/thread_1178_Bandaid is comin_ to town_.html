<br/>
Who might be available to meet up with her?<br/>
<br/>
She arrives Sat. evening 5/27, and is staying at the Parc Rennaissance<br/>
(which I assume is in SF). Her hope is to get together for dinner or<br/>
something on Sunday late afternoon or evening. She says she'll even<br/>
carve a stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone want to suggest a place to meet up?<br/>

5/27 and return Monday 5/29, so I could do Monday night dinner or<br/>

<br/>
Still hoping for a local gathering sometime...<br/>
