                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone who expressed an interest &amp; e-mailed me their<br/>
preferences for scheduling the class. Almost everyone prefer Sundays.<br/>
Although I initially wanted to schedule it in January, that won't work<br/>
for me now due to travel plans and out-of-town company.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm going to hold the class on Sunday, February 10, from 1:00 PM<br/>
to about 3:00 at my apartment. I hope that works for most of you.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan on coming, send a quick e-mail to: pgonyea @ earthlink<br/>
.net (remove the spaces), and feel free to attach an image you'd like<br/>
to see me prepare. I also have a scanner and we can scan in images for<br/>
your use as well.<br/>
<br/>
I'll send back my address, phone #, and directions to my apartment.<br/>
<br/>
My experimental "Tabula Rasa" letterbox will be available at the<br/>
class. To participate in this letterboxing project, read the<br/>
directions at:<br/>
http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/tabula.htm <br/>
and bring your paper with the 2 written statements to the class.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing you on Sunday, February 10th.<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!<br/>
<br/>
Paul in SF<br/>
