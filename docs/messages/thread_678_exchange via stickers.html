I agree with Don and Gwen.  This is only my second gathering...my <br/>
first I attended after only letterboxing for about 6 weeks and I was <br/>
mostly interested in going after all those fun boxes.  But now that I <br/>
have been at it not quite a year I am more interested in meeting and <br/>
talking to some folk who share my particular aovcation/obsession.  Of <br/>
course, I am leaving at 6 am so I can do some boxing earlier in the <br/>
general SAc/Davis area.....<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the people who want to do alot of boxing can bring stamps and us <br/>
old timers will sit back and drink lemonade in the shade and trade <br/>
stories and stamps while the newbies race around Old Sac.  We can <br/>
visit with them the next gathering once their zeal has mellowed.  <br/>

Been there, done that, suspect I know how you feel Black Cavalier<br/>
