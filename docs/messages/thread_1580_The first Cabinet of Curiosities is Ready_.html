                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally! I met with the hosting store's staff today, and they're <br>
pleased to be the guardians of the first Cabinet of Curiosities item.<br>
<br>
I'm planning to do a small set of these items. They're not a series, <br>
as each item stands on its own, and can be collected inidividually.<br>
<br>
The link to the clue is:<br>

<br>
As is often the case with my curiosities, make sure you have an entire <br>
logbook page to devote to this collector's item.<br>
