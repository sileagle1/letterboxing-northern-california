Grumpy and I have carved a number of stamps the past few weeks, but <br/>
we have yet to find hiding places for all of them.  We released one <br/>
hitchiker last week, our Galloping Gobbler.  We were delighted to <br/>
hear right away from its finder, but are now wondering where he is <br/>
off to.<br/>
<br/>
This leads me to my big question:  Am I the only one who finds it <br/>
difficult to send stamps off as hitchhikers, knowing that we might <br/>
never see or hear about it again?  Would you, as letterboxers, <br/>
rather find a hitchhiker or have a new box to search for?<br/>

I would rather have a new box to search for - I actually have a thing <br/>
against hitchhikers.  I find them to be a nuisance as I always seem to <br/>
manage to forget to stamp something somewhere.  Also, I don't think it <br/>
takes as much effort or creativity to send out a hitchhiker - I am <br/>
speaking as a person who HATES to write clues, so maybe I am biased in <br/>
this regard.  I know finding good hiding spots is hard, but I think it <br/>
is worth the effort.  Other comments?<br/>
<br/>
And, regarding a potential "carving event," it's often helpful to have <br/>
a variety of people demonstrating techniques.  At the Kennedy Grove <br/>
event my then-8-year-old was able to show veteran DoubleSaj a thing or <br/>
two about image transferring.  Plus, it's just fun to sit around and <br/>
carve together.  I have seen photos from an event back East that took <br/>
place at some big mall where there were lots of public tables (in a <br/>
food court?).  It was during the wintertime so actual letterboxing was <br/>
not feasible, so this was good alternative.  Any mall rats out there <br/>
know any likely spots like this that are indoors and not too crowded <br/>
where we could locate this mini-event?<br/>

<br/>
I would rather have a new box to search for!<br/>
I used to call hitchhikers the Lazy Man's Letterbox. No box, no<br/>
clues-just a stamp and a book. <br/>
<br/>
I have only released 2 hitchhikers in my 3 years of letterboxing. I<br/>
tried to recall both of them after they had been out in the wild for a<br/>
year. One came back to me, but the other might still be out there.<br/>
(Alfred Hitchcock Hitchhiker) When I was recalling the hitchhikers I<br/>
had people emailing me that they had transported Alfred to Washington<br/>
State, but they would not tell me the letterbox where they had placed<br/>
him! I begged and pleaded on the Pacific Northwest board, the Main<br/>
letterboxing board and the Hitchhiker board for more information. But<br/>
Alfred has disappeared into the ether where the lost hitchhikers go to<br/>
die!<br/>
<br/>
I still try to support others hitchhiking efforts. I was even<br/>
instrumental in planting 9 hitchhikers in the Seattle area for a HH<br/>
Race back to Pennslyvania.  (only 2 of these HH's have been heard<br/>
from, even though the others have been picked up and moved along)<br/>
Sometimes, I think the HH's are just too much work for people.<br/>
Remembering to stamp the book and their logbook too. And remembering<br/>
to annouce to one of the boards that they found the HH and moved it<br/>
along. And then again, some folks feel that HH's should be secretive<br/>
and a "surprise" in a letterbox and refuse to annouce their movements. <br/>
That was part of the reason the Hitchhiker talk list was created.<br/>
People did not want their HH info posted to the main talk list! <br/>
<br/>
More than 2 cents on the subject!<br/>

That's a tough one!! HHs are such fun to find but, as an HH carver, it IS <br/>
difficult to watch them fly the nest, cut the apron strings, etc. There's nothing <br/>
better than finding a new box on "What's New" right in your own backyard but <br/>
an HH, well, that's just so special!<br/>

I personally like new letterboxes because it affords the chance to explore new <br/>
places. I think HH's are fun though. I previously had Mr. Pecksniff HH in my <br/>
care. I picked him up in Pleasant Hill, CA... and dropped him off in a place that <br/>
now might have snow.<br/>
<br/>
The logbook for the Gallopping Gobbler is pretty big, so he's awaiting a <br/>
letterbox that can hold him and his luggage!  I try to go letterboxing every <br/>
weekend...and he's anxious to be on his way!<br/>
