Looks like Im on my own for the Sac gathering in April, so Im <br/>
looking for anyone interested in sharing a ride to make the drive <br/>
shorter. My ideal situation would be to drive up early on Sat. <br/>
morning to be at the gathering, attend said gathering, and hang <br/>
around - either to do more LB or hang out / have dinner in Old Sac. <br/>
with local LBs &amp; others who just havent had enough. And then stay <br/>
night, get up, do more Sac LB and return to Bay Area late <br/>
afternoon/evening. OR drive up Fri. afternoon before, stay night <br/>
return to Bay Area Sat evening, or even Up &amp; back all on Sat. <br/>
Whatever, Im flexible and open to suggestions. Im willing to take my <br/>
car and will be leaving from Petaluma &amp; willing to go a little out <br/>
of my way. <br/>
If Interested please email me off board.<br/>
Thanks, Wascally Wabbit (Chris)<br/>
