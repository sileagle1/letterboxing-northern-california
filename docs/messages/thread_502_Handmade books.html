I think Alien Explorers are the best book makers. but I have been <br>
refining my technique and find if I make them assembly line style I <br>
can do it much faster. That is, I take some good quality acid free <br>
paper to Kinko's and use their paper cutter to make good size pages <br>
(you can walk right in and use it, just sitting on the self-service <br>
counter) Then I use my swiss army knife awl tool .....that has been <br>
the best thing I have found for boring holes thru many layers <br>
simultaneously.  I have used raffia or actually my favorite is waxed <br>
dental floss for tying/binding the pages. 3 holes seems to work <br>
best.  I also use a good size needle with the floss or raffia and <br>
they stitch up easily.  <br>
<br>
I made 8 books in one hour a while back.  <br>
