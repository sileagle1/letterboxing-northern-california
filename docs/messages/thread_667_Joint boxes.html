                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've collaborated on some joint boxes (2 with Princess Lea). I mostly helped <br/>
create clues, because it can be hard coordinating schedules to plant, etc. I <br/>
figure that since I didn't plant it, I don't count it. In fact, I like <br/>
creating clues and carving WAY over planting, as a couple of boxes that were <br/>
never planted can attest to.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun, equally joint venture, that can be coordinated with 2 <br/>
independent plantings (and earn separate P counts, of course) are paired <br/>
boxes, like Mimulus and I did recently for the Wine Country series. My <br/>
"Sleep, Drunken Bacchus" speaks to Mim's "Embittered Demeter" in an odd, <br/>
fun, conversational sort of way - each box stands alone, but coordinates <br/>
with the other. You just can't mix Greek gods with Roman gods without some <br/>
wine nearby, you know. We did a LOT of planning out details through e-mails.<br/>
