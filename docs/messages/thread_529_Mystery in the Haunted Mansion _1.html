Tuesday looked again for Mystery in the Haunted Mansion #1 but still <br/>
couldn't find it. Is this missing? or am I being clueless?<br/>
<br/>
The Mntnbikemann's could not find #1 on February 6th when they did the<br/>
series.  We found it and logged in on New Year's Eve.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, it sounds like from the 3 reports that the darn thing is gone <br/>
again.  Amazing that it lasted only about a month in its newer, safer <br/>
location, as opposed to more than a year is its highly exposed first <br/>
location.  I blame the squirrels.  I don't know when I'll get back to <br/>
SF - I also need to check on Summer of Love which may also be missing.  <br/>
Next (long) weekend, I am headed up to Sonoma and Mendocino counties <br/>
and plan to pack in as many LBs as possible.  Are any of the boxes in <br/>
Sugarloaf missing at this time?<br/>
<br/>
I spent almost 4 hours up at Redwood Park yesterday doing Blackbird's <br/>
Who Goes There? series.  All I can say is ouch, my muscles are sore <br/>
today.  Hope the hills in Sugarloaf are not this bad - I am becoming <br/>
afraid after reading Kool Kats and aT's reports!  I was right behind <br/>
someone called Rebel Yells - are you guys in this list?  I must have <br/>
just missed you.  And also Janaland had been there on Friday and <br/>
dropped off a series of HH's called TGIF - there appear to be 4 in the <br/>
series and I got 3 of them.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of HH's, I'd like to make a little comment:  when you drop one <br/>
off, please be sure to stamp the box stamp into the HH's log.  <br/>
Theoretically the HH logbook should have a record of all the boxes <br/>
visited by the HH and every person who carried it.  Please don't make <br/>
the picker-upper have to stamp the box's stamp into the log!  <br/>
Invariably they will be in a hurry and just grab the HH, and then find <br/>
out when they get home that the box stamp was not done (which  suppose <br/>
would mean they should return to the box and get it.  Like that's gonna <br/>
happen).<br/>

in this area!<br/>
