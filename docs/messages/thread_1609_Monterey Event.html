Yes, I started this rumbling about a Monterey Gathering at the Am. <br/>
River Gathering.  I am hoping to enlist the help of Baker St. <br/>
Searchers and mtnbikemanns.  At this moment, I have Veteran's <br/>
Memorial Park in mind but I'm also checking into other parks.   <br/>
<br/>
I've looked into Monterey's scheduled events.  May is not a good <br/>
month to do it.  The month of June will be better and it looks like <br/>
the week-end of 14th &amp; 15th, but we could possibly do the following <br/>
week-end, as well. <br/>
<br/>
I want to call it K.I.S.S.  M. E.  for KEEP IT S &amp; S  MONTEREY EVENT  <br/>
You can fill in the S's with whatever works for you.  Simply Simple, <br/>
Simply Superb, Superb &amp; Stupendous, etc.  (See below)<br/>
<br/>
The term KISS is an acronym of the phrase "Keep It Simple, Stupid", <br/>
and the KISS principle states that design simplicity should be a key <br/>
goal and unnecessary complexity avoided.  Other versions of the <br/>
phrase include "Keep It Simple &amp; Stupid" (most recently used in west-<br/>
European literature), "Keep It Sweet &amp; Simple," "Keep It Short &amp; <br/>
Simple," "Keep it Simple, Sweetheart," and "Keep it Simple, <br/>
Sherlock," and the obvious scatological variation.<br/>
The principle roughly corresponds to Occam's razor, and to Albert <br/>
Einstein's maxim that "everything should be made as simple as <br/>
possible, but no simpler." <br/>
<br/>
I want it to be easy for everyone to letterbox and "meet and greet" <br/>
without  trying to plan and bring food, ice, etc. for everyone else.  <br/>
<br/>
I will get it posted on the Event Calendar, but may have to make some <br/>
changes with the park and or the date.  VM Park has about 20 camping <br/>
spaces for RV's or trailers and quite a few tent spaces on a first <br/>
come basis.  No reservations.  It is a park high above the bay.  <br/>
Those of you that has gotten Wharf Cat will know where this park is.<br/>

June in Monterey sounds wonderful. Of course your scheduling will need <br/>
to accommodate many folks' needs.  Just want to remind you all that <br/>
the letterboxing cruise leaves from New York two weeks later.  We will <br/>
be on the road letterboxing our way across country soon after the <br/>
15th.  So our preference would be no later than June 14th/15th. <br/>
