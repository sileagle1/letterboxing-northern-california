Well I spent the last three dys in a windlwless conference room in <br>
Berkeley, within 10 miles of at least a dozen letterboxes.  <br>
Unfortunately it was a very good conference, and  I did not want to <br>
miss any lectures and we got very short break for lunch.  IT was <br>
dark the first two days we got out, and I just drove straight home.  <br>
But the last day we got out at 4:30 so I zipped over to get Icarus!  <br>
Oh joy!  finally found it on the third try.  What fun!   <br>

Sorry you were holed up in that awesome conference!  Thanks to you - we were able to get outdoors and enjoy Sugarloaf Ridge SP - along with a few others!  It was also our first day to stamp in with our new trail stamp and name....so BugZ, ez2love and AntZ are now...The Boxalots...(coming to a box near you!)<br>
 <br>
Your boxes were quite busy yesterday!  When we arrived at the observatory - we practically ambushed the wonderful Kool Kats!  Poor Gary and Carole - there were so many of us in our group (7) - I'm afraid we overwhelmed them!  We were so glad to get an exchange...and I discovered something new....I apparently could sit and talk with other boxers about boxing for quite awhile!  I had to force myself to carry on....it was great to meet you guys!  <br>
 <br>
We left Da Kool Kats in the midst of stamping into the first few boxes of the Planet Walk and journeyed further into the solar system and began with Red Rover....loved the stamps and voyaged all the way to Neptune picking up each box before the kiddos gave out.  Also thanks to Alien Explorers for the too cute Abamit and her Shadow!  After reveling in the splendid views from Neptune...we headed back to Earth with a surprise stop at Jupiter.  We met Wascally Wabbit and Flower there!  After more exchanging...and talking!....we moved on to Earth.  Picked up the beginning boxes in the series and marveled at the quality of the stamps!<br>
 <br>
We are eager to return and get Pluto and the other series in the park along with the Pomo Hummingbird.<br>
 <br>
Thanks again for another amazing day of boxing...I think your P count must be higher than your F count!  <br>
<br>
Take care, BugZ of The Boxalots<br>
