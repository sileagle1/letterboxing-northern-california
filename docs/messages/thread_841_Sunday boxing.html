                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I just couldn't stand it, I had to get outta Dodge for cooler climes & new boxes, so I acted on a wild hair and drove down to San Francisco for the day yesterday. Added the following to my book:<br>
<br>
Barkin' at the Moon<br>
Nepenthe--great location<br>
Mim's Tin Tin series--awesome! (a little brain cramp)<br>
Columba + one other, same location--a very interesting place, despite the cat pee smell<br>
San Francisco Church<br>
Magritte, the Terapeutist*<br>
Notus, the South Wind* (FF!) + one other, same location<br>
Ortus Depth*--*these three Paul's hinged stamps, elaborate & beautiful<br>
<br>
I looked and looked for Playland Lives, to no avail. I thought I had the right circle of stones, but that was where it ended. No burned out log, nothing else fit just right. I was too tired to go driving to see if I hadn't gone far enough, and wouldn't claim the box missing, since I'm not sure I was in exactly the right spot. Just couldn't tell where 0 was supposed to be taken from...sometimes I get so confused!<br>

Gotta go catch some winks now, it was a long day!<br>

Playland since I have had several reports of its MIA status, including <br>
from someone who had found it previously!  I can hardly believe I'm <br>
going to be finder #3 (or possibly higher) on Paul's box that's less <br>
than a old.<br>
