<br/>
Went to Reno and Tahoe for a wedding this weekend and did as much <br/>
boxing as time allowed. Here's the report<br/>
<br/>
+ I-80 Series Box 2 - alive and well<br/>
+ Bear Cub - alive and well... the creek has water now<br/>
+ Rainbow Bridge - alive and repaired... no logbook so we left an <br/>
extra one that we had.<br/>
+ Patty Reed's Doll - alive but the book is totally full.. we didn't <br/>
have any more logbooks so whoever goes next needs to take one.<br/>
+ I Miss My Cats - alive and well<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed all the boxes especially the rainbow bridge... I thought <br/>
I was cleaver and used my rainbow stamp pad!<br/>
<br/>
Had time to plant a box in Reno.. couldn't believe there wasn't any <br/>
in Reno!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have missed the gabbering... sounded like lots of fun<br/>

we'll get a new log book in Rainbow Bridge. Thanks for your concern!<br/>

The Patty Reed's Doll is the one that needs a new logbook. We put a new logbook in Rainbow bridge.<br/>
Fun boxes!<br/>

Thanks for the update on a couple of our I-80 series. Coincidentally, <br/>
yesterday, we replanted I-80 box #3 (or #4 as we've renumbered them) and will <br/>
have <br/>
the new clue up shortly. I think we're going up to Tahoe again this weekend so <br/>
we'll get a new log book in Rainbow Bridge. Thanks for your concern!<br/>
