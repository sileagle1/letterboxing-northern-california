celebrate Boxing Day by making a day of letterboxing.  (We couldn't<br/>
celebrate more traditionally, since we have no servants to give<br/>
presents to...)<br/>
<br/>
We biked two sections of the San Francisco Bay Trail, and found a<br/>
number of great letterboxes by Princess Lea. First we found the Lunar<br/>
New Year's series, as well as a neighboring geocache.  Then we had a<br/>
late lunch at the Sushi House (the nearby letterbox was one of the<br/>
first thhat Robb and I ever found).  Then we biked from Sushi House to<br/>
Crustacean Inlet.  We failed to find Neptune Beach, but did find the<br/>
hybrid geocache/letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of geocaches, I noticed that someone had planted a<br/>
geocache in the same little park as my Rose series (in fact they<br/>
mention my letterboxes in their clues), so I dropped them an email,<br/>
introducing myself.  Here's the reply I got:<br/>
<br/>
"I think the rose garden is an amazing place and I live just a few<br/>
blocks from there.  Coincidentally, I spent hours looking for nice<br/>
places to hide my ultimate cache and accidentally DID discover 2<br/>
letterboxes in the garden-- all without any clues.  They were really<br/>
well hidden (guess it shows I took a long time to find the right spot<br/>
for the cache box I wanted to use.)  Once I discovered they were<br/>
there, I put a warning in my geocache page so that others who found<br/>
them by accident would not harm them.  So far, others HAVE found them<br/>
and reported they found the game interesting and they took great care<br/>
to place them back as they found them."<br/>
<br/>
Now, it happens that Robb and I checked on these boxes of mine the day<br/>
before xmas, and they were almost *too* well hidden.  We actually<br/>
thought one was missing at first.  So, I'm pleased to say that Alameda<br/>
County Geocachers are very thoughtful and very good re-hiders!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing Day!<br/>
