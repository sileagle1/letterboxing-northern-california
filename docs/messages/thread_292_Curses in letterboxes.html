Yes, as Princess Lea said, I now put a slip of paper with a curse <br/>
inside my boxes saying something to the effect of:<br/>
<br/>
   "This letterbox is protected by a very strong curse. Anyone who    <br/>
removes this box from its location will have bad things happen to <br/>
them, and they will suffer from the consequences."<br/>
<br/>
I sure don't take this curse seriously, but there are a LOT of <br/>
superstitious people out there who will think twice before tampering <br/>
with or removing the box.<br/>
<br/>
It's not foolproof, but if it works 10% of the time, it's worth it!<br/>
<br/>
You know what they say: What goes around, comes around"... and the <br/>
rat that messed with Lea's box, will have to answer for it somehow in <br/>
the grand scheme of fate.<br/>
