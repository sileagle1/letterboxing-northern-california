Last week I got an email from someone I'd never heard of regarding a Mystery box I hid in a NP. It was very vague and a little suspicious. So I emailed a few people for their opinions on what I should do. It was split, "respond" said some , "don't" said others... anyway I was feeling a little paranoid about it thinking it was a NPS employee looking to det rid of it. i noticed the email address was an AOL account, so I plugged his email into my rarely used aol IM "buddies" list at work. When I saw he was online I asked him what he had so far(regading the clues) and he said he'd found the box already, which was under water. Dried it out and rehid it. turns out he's from Chicago on vacation and uses Ltrbxg so he doesn't get bored on trips w/family. No trail name yet and no stamp. I asked how he likes it and he said, It's "IL". So I asked is that IL as in illin', and he said yeah it was. So hopefully we have a young Chicagoin becoming more involved in ltrbxg. Maybe I'll do and "IL" box<br/>
 soon.<br/>
