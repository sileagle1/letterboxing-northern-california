<br>
When I discovered that Nepenthe had been geotrashed, I let loose with enough foul language to make a whole squadron of Marines blush. When some reasonable and calm  behavior returned, I left a note in the geocache (Sharpie Pen, Fluorescent paper) asking that group to please learn the difference between a letterbox and a geocache, and not take rubberstamps in exchange (for useless, uninteresting debris that couldn't amuse a 2 year old --my thoughts, but I didn't write that on my note).<br>
<br>
 Later, I logged on to the Geocache site, got the e-mail address of the geocacher who placed it there, and wrote a brief 25,000 word e-mail thesis on why I want to keep Nepenthe there. I told them that many intelligent, clever letterboxers worked hard to research Greek mythology and risked imaginary perils to get the correct directions for the box. Of course, I mentioned the wonderful feedback I've received from finders and the pleasant surprise of the special location. Now there would be NO way for letterboxers to forget all their worries, cares, and sorrows now that the world has no Nepenthe.<br>
<br>
I also asked that we figure out a way to peacefully coexist at the same spot. I wrote in a cooperative, pleasant tone, and never mentioned what I wanted to do to their geocache in revenge.  Neighborly.<br>
<br>
That was about a week ago. No response yet. Was all that pleasant neighborliness ignored? Was I expected to simply bow and curtsy to them and evacuate from the site? <br>
<br>
 WELL,... maybe it's time for me to go geocaching -- I have the location of one in a familiar spot that I know well. Oh! What a coincidence! I have something rotten and smelly in the back of my refrigerator... REALLY NASTY!... But it's perfect for an exchange item at the geocache! [VERY EVIL GRIN]<br>
<br>
I know that you all realize that I'm just kidding... I wouldn't do such a thing, would I?  (Maybe my evil twin, Skippy, would though).<br>
<br>
Kidding...<br>
<br>
P.S. I recently e-mailed those people who had sent me great comments about Nepenthe. I related a personal story that explains the significance of Nepenthe to me and what the concept symbolized during a crucial and very difficult time in my life. I included an MP3 music file of a piece entitled, "Nepenthe" which inspired the letterbox.<br>
<br>
If you're interested in finding out this mysterious background to the Nepenthe box, drop me a quick e-mail line and I'll send the story and music to you. Due to the music file size, certain e-mail services may reject it, such as Hotmail. In that instance, you'll only receive the story unless you give me an alternate e-mail address. <br>

  We just moved one of our letterboxes"Unal Trail" that was placed on 4/19/2002. On 6/26/2004 some geocachers had the cajones to put their cache right next to our letterbox. Since we have had bad experiences with geocachers in the past we decided to let them have the spot and find another location. We then posted a fairly tactful message on their cache/log page to reflect the intrusion. I am not suggesting that you do the same, but I made sure that the geocachers had several caches in the area. Hopefully they will take my note properly and not start vandalizing letterboxes. <br>

    You know what really sucks about the whole geocache/letterbox <br>
    problem...is that letterboxing for the most part spells out exactly <br>
    where the box is, and there is no mistaking it for a geocache<br>
