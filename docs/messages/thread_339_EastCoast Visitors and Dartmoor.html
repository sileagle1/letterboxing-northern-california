Thanks to Doublesaj and Old Blue's connections in the letterboxing I <br/>
had the great pleasure of meeting Deanne, the lazy letterboxer and <br/>
her partner Dave, the Lettrboxing ham from MA.  I guess it helped <br/>
that the DD's have family who live in Sonoma too.  <br/>
<br/>
DOublesaj arranged for a beautiful day and makes the BEST brownies.  <br/>
Paul and 3vix joined us and we took off for further adventures as <br/>
daylight would allow.  <br/>
<br/>
Infortunatley Sierra Sally has not yet made a stamp fo rthe Sonoma <br/>
Mission (it is the most northern of the system).  Hmmmm that gives me <br/>
an idea for a box....anyway 3vix and Old Blue showed me some of their <br/>
CA State PArk stamps, great fun!  I had no ide those existed.  Gotta <br/>
start collecting them too, especially since I just bought an annual <br/>
State pass. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the most entertaining and interesting part was seeing DD's <br/>
pix, stamps, and hear stories about their trip to Dartmoor this <br/>
September.  They got 180 stamps in 3 days and are official members of <br/>
the DArtmoor 100 CLub and have patches to prove it.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, when I heard you can go into most DArtmoor area pubs, many <br/>
inns, museums and even petrol stations and get at least one stamp, <br/>
the bells went off in my head.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a great pub here, owned by a Brit, who has given me <br/>
permission to place a box there.  Originally I had planned to hide it <br/>
outside with elaborate clues, but now I think it will simply be <br/>
Dartmoor style.  You walk in the pub, ask the bartender for a <br/>
letterbox and he pulls it out from under the counter.  <br/>
<br/>
Deanne said they got 20 stamps in one pub.  Well to make a long story <br/>
short, I thought it would be a fun challenge (Providing the pub owner <br/>
goes for it) to have lots of boxes at this pub.  IT would be a great <br/>
spot for a future gathering down the road.<br/>
<br/>
Theri could be a string of British style pubs with letterboxes across <br/>
the state (Murphys Pub in Sonoma, etc.  the pub at the Benbow Inn in <br/>
GArberville), etc!  Excelsior!<br/>
<br/>
I am getting carried away, <br/>

What a great idea! Coincidentally, after we dropped Deanne and Dave off at <br/>
their car, we ate at Murphy's Pub in Sonoma! Cute place and a VERY good lamb <br/>
sandwich!<br/>
<br/>
The idea about a gathering at a pub is the best I've heard in ages!! Do It!!<br/>

Hi Mimulus!<br/>
I'm still working on getting the list of CA Sesquicentennial passport <br/>
stamps listed on my website. Maybe I can get some of that done this <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
There are at least a couple of letterboxes that are very close to the <br/>
CA 150 passport sites such as Oompa Loompa at Olompali and the Pigeon <br/>
Point Lighthouse. <br/>
<br/>
I'll try to post a link soon!<br/>
