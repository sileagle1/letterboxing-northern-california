HA!  Too many posts with 13s on it!  AND yes, it should've been a quick <br>
find!!  HA! <br>
Coming at the "N" tree from every direction except the one that shows <br>

   <br>
  We spent the day freezing at a cold, wet fishing derby with the Brownies - but then journeyed on and nabbed Proud Poultry, Good and Plentiful, Alien Smorgasbord and the Sandhill Crane box - all in great shape and remarkably dry.<br>
   <br>
  My brother is in town visiting (my non-letterboxing brother) - so I'll see if I can work some magic and get him to Point Reyes in the a.m.....<br>
   <br>
  If we are there- we will find you - if not....enjoy!<br>
   <br>
  Take care, Honour of the Boxalots<br>
