In checking the "Events" column at Atlas Quest, I see there is a "Dog Days" gathering in Michigan on the very weekend ours is scheduled in Oakland. Perhaps if we change the spelling/name to "Dog Daze in Oakland" there would be enough of a difference.<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I promised news soon about our August gathering. I'd like to go ahead and<br/>
finalize the date as Sunday, August 27! I'm also going to take Doublesaj<br/>
&amp; Old Blue's excellent suggestion and call this the LbNCA Dog Days<br/>
Gathering! Thanks for the great name.<br/>
<br/>
As for the location - I was set to make a reservation at Redwood Regional<br/>
for us, but then Lisa wrote me to tell about this other fantastic park in<br/>
Oakland that looks very scenic, inspiring, and accessible, among many<br/>
other desirable features. It has shoreline and estuary, views of the bay<br/>
and San Francisco, many paths, picnic tables with BBQ pit, no fees, clean<br/>
restrooms, and more. It's called Middle Harbor Shoreline Park and is in<br/>
Oakland, right on the bay (cool breezes!):<br/>
<br/>
http://www.ebparks.org/parks/midlhar.htm<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone object to moving the gathering here? I think Redwood is also<br/>
great, but Lisa's description of MHSP to me was glowing and the idea of it<br/>
is very inspiring. I'll definitely reserve a spot in one or the other<br/>
next week; if I hear no objections, I'll reserve at MHSP.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, 13 of you said in the poll that you could help with organization<br/>
if asked. Also, 11 of you said you'd be interested in a potluck, with two<br/>
of you indicating interest in BBQ. Can one or two of you 13 potential<br/>
volunteers contact me offlist, to help coordinate the potluck list (and<br/>
with potential availability in BBQ, anyone who wants to run that)? I'll<br/>
also need someone to help coordinate the letterbox planting/clue gathering<br/>
efforts.<br/>
<br/>
So, put it in your calendar now: August 27, LbNCA Dog Days Gathering! Who<br/>
would like to carve the event stamp? :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Eclipse<br/>
