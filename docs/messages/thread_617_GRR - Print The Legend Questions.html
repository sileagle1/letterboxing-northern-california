Well, you don't want my answers since I got some of them wrong.  So, if<br/>
you use my answers &amp; get the same questions wrong, Mimulus will know you<br/>
didn't watch the movie.<br/>

Mim, I think you SHOULD require all subsequent<br/>
contenders to answer a couple of extra questions;<br/>
counting the number of times Tom says Pilgrim is a<br/>
good one for having to watch the WHOLE movie. And for<br/>
his penance, Nils can check out the movie again and<br/>
give YOU the answer. :-) Whew, glad I was already a<br/>
finder and didn't have to resist temptation.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra Sally, remember that game we used to play in<br/>
school, "Telephone"? I keep thinking my life is going<br/>
to be more and more like that, the older I get.<br/>
