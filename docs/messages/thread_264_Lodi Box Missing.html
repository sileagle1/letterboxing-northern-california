Dear Grumpy Grinch,<br/>
Sorry to hear about the missing box.  Glad that we were the first and<br/>
probably the only finders.  Too bad that others missed the stamp.  It<br/>
was nicely done.  We had our doubts as to whether the box would<br/>
survive in it's hiding place and tried to cover it better, without<br/>
altering the clue.  Looking forward to others of yours.<br/>

Thanks for your nice comments about the stamp.  Grumpy went to <br/>
retrieve it after we returned from our cross-country sojourn late <br/>
last month.  He reported it missing.  Well Grinch went back another <br/>
day and found it!  We have removed the box and clues, but hope to <br/>
find a more secure location soon.  So the stamp is not lost, just <br/>
the previous location.  :-)  Once we rehide it and post the new <br/>
clues, you can find it again.  How cool is that?!?<br/>
<br/>
We have been searching numerous "possible letterbox" locations in <br/>
the Central Valley.  We also have been working on our carving and <br/>
stamp making techniques.  We hope to add to the local letterbox <br/>
count ere long.<br/>
<br/>
But today we drove to Napa County and found four boxes in lovely <br/>
locations.  It was a good day!<br/>
