Old Blue and I met Ferretmom (so called because whe has a pet ferret. . .duh) and her husband Jason (not quit yet a legitamate 'boxer) in Daivs on Sunday afternoon. Just the 4 of us and we had a nice chat and exchange. Turns out, she studied art in college and took a class which included learning how to carve rubber stamps! So she was a carver before she was a letterboxer. Her cute "Ferret-in-a-hot-air-balloon" personal stamp and ferret "footprints" personal traveler were, therefore, splended!<br>
<br>
Sorry you couldn't be there but we hear you had a nice visit with your guests.<br>
<br>
See you at BASS!<br>
