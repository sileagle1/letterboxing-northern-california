http://home.earthlink.net/~pgonyea/nepenthe.htm So this little box-<br>
baby is going to its new home.<br>
<br>
Nepenthe was a potion believed by the ancient Greeks to induce <br>
forgetfulness of cares, sorrows, and worries. The location of this <br>
letterbox is like that, too, It's a pretty unique and little known <br>
piece of SF terrain. I hope this gives you a reason to discover it.<br>
<br>
Before you go on your hunt, make sure that you've gotten all your <br>
Greek gods together -- (like ducks in a row). Many people who have <br>
guessed at them, guessed wrong, and the Nepenthe clues associated <br>
with wrong answers will send you on a wild Greek duck chase! A <br>
little research does the trick.<br>
<br>
Also, please note the equipment required for this hunt, as well as <br>
the severe hazards associated with it. You'll find this valuable <br>
info towards the bottom of the clue page [EVIL GRIN].<br>
<br>
Throw on a toga, and go on a quest for Nepenthe!<br>
