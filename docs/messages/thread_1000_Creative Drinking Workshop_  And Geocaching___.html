Wench's notion and follow the Creative Thinking Workshop with some<br/>
creative drinking.  Lock Wench is hosting Desperately Seeking Sun <br/>

I'm sorry to say that my best potential contribution to a Creative<br/>
Drinking event is currently making the rounds as a postal letterbox. <br/>
I carved a multi-block print called Absinthe, the Green Fairy, which<br/>
is flitting around the country.<br/>

I've been intrigued by dandelion wine, because it has such a Ray<br/>
Bradbury ring to it.  But dandelion sap is so bitter, that I can't<br/>
imagine what the finished wine might taste like.<br/>
<br/>
I've had homebrew Absinthe, but the swill my friend made probably had<br/>
about as much in common with the real Absinte as moonshine has in<br/>
common with single malt Scotch...<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of swill, we lost power for several hours this mornning,<br/>
and realized that we're not as "emergency prepared" as we could be.  <br/>
Nevertheless, Robb made a pretty funny coffee making contrapition, out<br/>
of a fondue set, three tea lights, aluminum foil, and a candy<br/>
thermometer.   He dubbed the result Desperation Brew.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I wanted to mention that Robb and I have a date (if it<br/>
isn't pouring) tomorrow with the geocachers who stumbled across my<br/>
rose boxes while hunting for a place to hide their geocache.  We've<br/>
going to try out each other's activities.  A good way for me to<br/>
"test-drive" a gps!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year, everyone!<br/>

<br/>
I do want to allow for some social time after the workshop. After all, <br/>
if people end up creatively stimulated, we'll all be bouncing ideas <br/>
off each other.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a small amount of pre-work that people should do before <br/>
coming to the workshop. I'll publish a web page with details, but <br/>
basically, you arrive with certain ideas that we'll work with. For <br/>
now, here are 2 things you can begin thinking about. If you have a <br/>
small notebook or journal that's easy to carry around, make it into <br/>
your 'idea book', and write down your thoughts about these 2 questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. What is YOUR definition of what a letterbox is?<br/>
2. What attributes can a letterbox have (i.e., size, hiding place, <br/>
logbook, etc.). List as many as you can come up with -- then see if <br/>
you can come up with some new ones.<br/>
<br/>
Then, start a list in your idea book of themes and categories that <br/>
encompass areas like historical periods, environments, geography, <br/>
sacred/special places, art/architectural styles, pastimes, symbols, <br/>
things magical/supernatural/mythological, notable people, ethnic <br/>
groups, moods, ephemera... and ... and<br/>
<br/>
You can find items for your list by looking around your home, at your <br/>
books, music, movies... and thinking about what catches your eye and <br/>
interests you.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a bit of my list (some of these have inspired boxes or quilts <br/>
or...)<br/>
<br/>
Venice, volcanos, medieval pageant plays, ancient Rome, old maps, <br/>
spice trade, Silk Road, voodoo, Atlantis, mazes, Eden, the circus, <br/>
totem poles, superstitions, Versailles, the Crusades, Art Deco, <br/>
croquet, planting and harvesting cycles, fireworks, eclipses, <br/>
fountains, Greek mythology, masks, illuminated manuscripts...  <br/>
<br/>
Once you start compiling this list, you'll be amazed at how handy <br/>
it'll be -- for a variety of things, not just boxes. And, you can <br/>
begin combining themes to come up with real novel concepts. Guess <br/>
what? This is what Cirque du Soleil does -- they blended gypsy music <br/>
with Icarus and the rain forest to create 'Varekai'.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Lisa, dandelion wine uses just the petals of the flower, not <br/>
the greens. When you cook a lot of dandelion petals to make wine, the <br/>
smell is incredible. The finished wine doesn't taste like anything <br/>
you'd be familiar with. Traditionally, you pick the flowers and make <br/>
the wine in the spring, and drink the wine around Christmas. And yes, <br/>
my dandelion wine making friends did a performance of Ray Bradbury's <br/>
story in the stage version...<br/>
