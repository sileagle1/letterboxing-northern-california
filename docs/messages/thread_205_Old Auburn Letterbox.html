Actually technically this is the Old Old Auburn Letterbox<br>
It was placed in 2000<br>
was there until 2002 when a City Maint. Worker picked it up<br>
It was returned to me a short time ago,<br>
I have replaced it in exactly the same spot.<br>
Original log, box and stamp. only the baggies are new... <br>
 If you missed it before, now is your chance to go get it.<br>
<br>
Directions:<br>
Go to Old Town Auburn,<br>
Ask for Claude Chana<br>
Claude's Right Thumb is pointing a bearing directly at the box.<br>
Its less then 4 paces away about chest height.<br>
<br>
While your there take 2 paces and find the North Fork Dry Digging's <br>
box too!<br>
<br>
