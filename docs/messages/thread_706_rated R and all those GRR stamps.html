                    <div class="plaintext-content">There must be some special juju about that particular Greatest Liar <br>
location.  On my very first weekend of letterboxing, I had problems <br>
with that spot.  I had successfully extracted the box, and did my <br>
stamping, but when I went to replace the box, the beer drinking <br>
tailgaters had all coverged on the area.  As a new 'boxer, I had no <br>
idea what the best course of action was, so I took the box home and <br>
replaced it the next day.  I even picked up the beer cans.  <br>
<br>
I got to see a pink tushie on the trail while hunting Who Goes <br>
There.  Apparently the woman I almost tripped over didn't want to <br>
leave the trail and find a convenient bush.  Her hiking partner was <br>
doing a very poor job of standing guard as she answered the call of <br>
nature.  I threw up my hand to sheild my eyes, and scooted back down <br>
the path, waited about two minutes and came rattling and crashing <br>
back, all the while feeling like a complete doofus.<br>
<br>
Ah nature!  Ah spring!<br>

ps -- how do all those KMartha and Cheese Racing stamps work?  I <br>
figured it was a case of "if you have to ask, you can't afford it."  <br>
So I admired them, but didn't ask for an impression.<br>

I have to say I don't blame her. When I did Who Goes There at the beginning of April, there was juicy poison oak EVERYWHERE. Two of the boxes were literally buried in it. I would prefer the world to see my pink tushie than to contract poison oak on same.<br>
