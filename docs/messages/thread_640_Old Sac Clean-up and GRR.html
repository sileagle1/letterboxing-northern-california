Do not plant any Letterboxes for the GRR until after April 23rd!  PG&E<br>
is planning a "clean-up" of Old Sac on April 23rd and it may not be a<br>
good idea to have any floating around at that time.  I'm fairly sure<br>
that "Old Sac" by NancyAnn & Doug is well hidden enough that it should<br>
be safe, but others should be aware of the above mentioned "clean<br>
sweep."  See the blurb below.  It's called Earth Day 2005 and you can<br>
go to  http://www.pge.com/ and see what other state parks and parks<br>
that are affected in other counties.  It lists all of the counties and<br>
what areas they are cleaning up, just in case there are boxes in other<br>
areas that may be in jeopardy.<br>
