<br/>
I'm so happy I found my compass in a pocket of my shorts, right where it should have been when I couldn't find it. There are so many cargo pockets in those shorts, that, combined with my feeble short-term memory, make for great hiding places. I could probably hide a box in one and stump myself in trying to find it! The compass went throught the wash, but seems just fine.<br/>

Happy Mothers' day to all the mothers!!!<br/>
