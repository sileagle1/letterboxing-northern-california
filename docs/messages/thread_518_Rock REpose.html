Hi Carole, <br/>
<br/>
I did plant MAgnificent GLow associated with Rock, but no others <br/>
yet.  Definitely don't go after that one...it is steeper than Planet <br/>
Walk (but just as beautiful) and not worth a climb for only one <br/>
average box...it is for people like Tara's DH who like long hikes.  <br/>
I had considered linking it with a side loop thru the old orchard <br/>
but when i went to go investigate it was a very sad and forlorn <br/>
place....a few decrepit apple and fig trees being swallowed by the <br/>
encroaching forest so I gave up on that possibility.    <br/>
<br/>
