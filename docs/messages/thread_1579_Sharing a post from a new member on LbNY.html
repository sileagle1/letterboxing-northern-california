          From a LbNY (Letterboxing NY) posting -- <br/>
A new letterboxer asks:<br/>
Do letterboxers have a secret sign or something? Fill me in. <br/>

The reply:<br/>
LOL. Sign yes, secret, no. LOL Letterboxers are the ones who:<br/>

You'll pass at least twice on the trail. When you pass them the <br/>
second time, they will look suspiciously casual as they sit on a rock <br/>
in the middle of nowhere and the will either be extra pleasant as <br/>
they greet you or instantly turn to the nearest tree and pretend to <br/>
be: examining a leaf, tying a shoe or rummaging in the bottom of <br/>
their knapsack so as to NOT have to greet you.<br/>
They will sometimes be found standing in a small group in the middle <br/>
of the trail muttering to each other and most likely be holding a <br/>
piece of paper that looks like it's been folded and refolded at least <br/>
thirty times. Occasionally you'll find said paper carefully <br/>
ensconced in a plastic sheet protector.<br/>
They may or may NOT be holding a compass but either way chances are <br/>
they'll be turning in circles or venturing slightly off the trail <br/>
looking under logs and rocks. <br/>
If you decide to question them, you may get any number of variety <br/>
response such as:<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for salamanders.<br/>
I'm part of a group of leprechaun hunters. ( I actually used this <br/>
one once I don't even think they noticed)<br/>
I lost a contact. (Careful with the I "losts", they might offer to <br/>
help)<br/>
I'm really into this hobby where we follow clues around the woods <br/>
looking for hidden plastic ware that has a stamp and a notepad in <br/>
it. Despite the ticks and poison ivy and deer flies and heat and <br/>
chances of twisting an ankle in the middle of nowhere a bazillion <br/>
miles from the nearest cell tower.<br/>
<br/>
You might even be able to tell a letterboxer while shopping in your <br/>
favorite X-Mart. If you are in line and the person in front of you <br/>
has in their cart any combination of: camo tape, rubber made <br/>
containers, Ziploc bags, magic markers, 5 packs of vinyl erasers, <br/>
inkpads, bug spray, index cards, Strathmore sketch pads, or golf <br/>
pencils, chances are they're a letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
I actually met one in Price Chopper when we both went down the aisle <br/>
and almost screamed when we saw the Lock N Locks 3x4 containers were <br/>
on sale for $1.29. we both started stacking them in our carts it <br/>
got faster and faster until we were down to 3 I looked at her and <br/>
said "Are you a letterboxer?" and got back one of the biggest grins <br/>
I've ever got from a total stranger.<br/>
