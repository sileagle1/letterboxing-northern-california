                    <div class="plaintext-content">The following letterboxes are alive and well:<br>
<br>
A Gift in the Redwoods<br>
St. Patrick's series #1-4 (#5 is probably fine too, but we could not <br>
get to it due to rain)<br>
The Birds #1 and #2<br>
Sea Creatures #1-3<br>
Deers of West Dartmoor<br>
Bodega Bay<br>
<br>
We had a funny encounter at Sea Creatures #2 - there were some slightly <br>
confused looking folks standing by one of the markers with a piece of <br>
paper in their hands.  The they saw us march into the trees with OUR <br>
piece of paper and asked if we were letterboxing.  We said we were, and <br>
so we joined forces.  Turns out this box (and #1 in the series) had <br>
been planted by Mimulus in  honor of the 2 children in this family!  <br>
Once the box was found, I explained about the exchange of stamps, etc. <br>
and I think it made more sense to them.  They had left their journal in <br>
the car, and didn't have personal stamps yet so we couldn't do an <br>
exchange.  This was the first time I had ever run into anyone on the <br>
trails!<br>
