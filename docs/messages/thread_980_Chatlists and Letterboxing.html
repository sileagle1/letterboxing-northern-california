is always interesting that in the majority of the time how very <br/>
little there is an effort to push any one particular political or <br/>
philosophical point of view. There are among us secularists, and <br/>
some that would be considered very religious. While the majority <br/>
falls somewhere in between, there are a whole host of topics, and I <br/>
don't think I really need to mention them, that left wingers, right <br/>
wingers, maybe most of those inbetweeners would have difficulty in <br/>
keeping an appropriate discussion on without creating a potential <br/>
flame. I think it was truly amazing that during the last <br/>
presidential race that letterboxing was that one space that you <br/>
could escape to and get away from the political rhetoric. Sure there <br/>
was the sarcasm of the Kerry interview on the Pepe's pages, but all <br/>
in all it was fairly free of the politics that tend to create <br/>
divides. Letterboxing is a unique and different type of hobby/game <br/>
and I would rather not see any particular point of view pushed in <br/>
this or any other list. Lets continue to discuss carving, hiding, <br/>
stamps, containers, techniques, tips, clues, and other assorted <br/>
aspects of letterboxing and leave the boycotts to others. I have no <br/>
intention of creating a flame on this and will not respond to any <br/>
criticism either on or off list. This is strictly my opinion and has <br/>
nothing to do with my personal feelings on anything other than <br/>
letterboxing.  I don't post this lightly and have taken most of the <br/>
day in composing this note. I hope that it is read in the spirit it <br/>
is written, as I mean no ill will and only wish to keep the emphasis <br/>
on letterboxing.<br/>
