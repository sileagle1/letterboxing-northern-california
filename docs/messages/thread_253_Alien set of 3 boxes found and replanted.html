<br/>
I'm delighted to share with you that our family went to a famous pointed<br/>
national park in Marin yesterday, where we found Alien box 1 in perfect<br/>
condition. We then replanted Alien's Spaceship and Alien's Planet in new<br/>
locations, making this a truly sweet experience. Three locations a short<br/>
drive away from each other, two lovely, short hikes, one with a panoramic<br/>
view, ending at a gorgeous beach - what more can you ask for? (Okay, so the<br/>
stamps might not be very complex - but we love them, and they were designed<br/>
by a youngster!).<br/>
<br/>
We were delighted to find there had been several visitors, and hope more of<br/>
you might enjoy these boxes before the rains begin (will they last???).<br/>
<br/>
New clues are on the letterboxing website.<br/>
