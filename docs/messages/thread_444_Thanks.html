Thanks to all who attended the carving event!  I'm back at school <br/>
(don't have a computer at home so I've been enjoying catching <br/>
up on all the posts here!)  And thanks for all the great posts, it <br/>
was fun and most excellent to meet you all.<br/>
<br/>
Now to start planning a few small road trips to find all these <br/>
great boxes I've been reading about.<br/>
<br/>
I was back in Illinois for the holidays and braved the 7 degree <br/>
weather to find a box-it was there, I was frozen...but happy!<br/>
<br/>
It's good to be back-<br/>
