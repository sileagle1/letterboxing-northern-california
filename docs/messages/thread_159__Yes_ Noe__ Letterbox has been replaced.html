Yeah!  That'll teach them some RESPECT!<br>
<br>
Oh, you are a hoot, Paul!  =)<br>
<br>
I haven't seen any of your hiding places for your boxes, but they do <br>
sound EXTREMELY urban and public, and those boxes just like to go <br>
missing a lot.  I doubt it's anyone preying on SF letterboxes from <br>
letterboxing.org--I think most lost boxes are crimes of opportunity.  <br>
However, if you're like me and tend to cause controversies, there <br>
might be a couple of people who are out to ruin your boxes.  <br>
<br>
I've never actually heard of anyone doing that, but for a high-<br>
profile guy like me, the thought does linger in the back of my head!  <br>
But I like to hide my boxes at the end of long, strenuous hikes.  <br>
Nobody wants to hike 20 miles just to throw one of my boxes away.  <br>
Nobody hates me THAT much!  =D  But then, virtually nobody ever goes <br>
out to find them either.  But hey, they NEVER go missing!  Three <br>
years and counting!  =)  (Two confirmed finds and counting!)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I hope these losses don't dampen your enthusiam for <br>
letterboxing too much.  You're much too good to lose!  Just keep it <br>
in mind when you hide a box, and think carefully about locations and <br>
techniques that might reduce the chance of them going missing.  <br>
Experience does help, however, and you seem to be getting plenty of <br>
that! =)<br>
<br>
Carpe diem!<br>
<br>
-- Ryan<br>
<br>
PS. A curse... I just love that idea.  =)  I might start putting <br>
curses and hexes on my boxes just for fun.  Any suggested reading <br>
sources that I can learn more about them?  =)<br>

Does anyone know how to rig up a letterbox to deliver a nasty electric shock when it's removed from its area?<br>

<br>
As for hiding places, I don't think they're obvious, but I suppose <br>
there are weird people who stand on their heads or crawl on their <br>
bellies in strange public places. I'm making a practice of replacing <br>
boxes in exactly the spot they were missing from, based on the <br>
notion that lightning doesn't strike the same spot twice.<br>
<br>
I am considering putting my polymer clay skills to work, and <br>
creating a false stone housing for my boxes. The Nepenthe <br>
replacement box will probably be the first trial for that camoflouge <br>
technique. Even though you heard people remark that it was near <br>
where folks were sitting, it wasn't anywhere near eye level. If I <br>
make it look like the rest of the rocks, that might help.<br>
<br>
And if I arm it with an alarm device that detonates an itching <br>
powder bomb if the correct code isn't entered within 15 seconds... <br>
that might help, don't you think, Ryan? <br>

Without a doubt.  I don't know what the MIA rates for boxes with such <br>
tamper-proof devices being used.  May be an interesting experiment.  <br>
