Dear DaCoolKats<br>
<br>
So glad that you came to the haunted house last night. After taking <br>
those other folks through the maze, I came back to talk to you, and <br>
couldn't find you. So sorry that I didn't get to talk to you more. <br>
<br>
Hope the tri was worth it. <br>
<br>
Hope to visit with you again soon. <br>
Sierra Sally<br>
