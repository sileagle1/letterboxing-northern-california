It's kind of a bit of work, but this is how I make my logbooks: <br/>
I use a paper cutter to cut blank notecards to whatever size I need <br/>
them to fit in a container, and then hole punch them and tie them <br/>
together with a string.  Very cheap, and customizeable.  But, like I <br/>
said, a bit of work.<br/>
Good tip with the printer though!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'd like to see more of the LbNCA group fill in<br/>
&gt; their profiles  &gt; and answer the interview questions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; They're fun to read.  We've filled in ours and I<br/>
&gt; check every   &gt; few days to see if any other of the<br/>
&gt; "regulars" has done so. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Only a very few have.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How do you access them? To fill in or to read<br/>
&gt; others...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; fyi--I went to a small printer today and bought small<br/>
&gt; pads that they had made out of scraps, mostly card<br/>
&gt; stock (good for stamping both sides). I had them cut<br/>
&gt; them in half, so they measure roughly 2 1/2 inches by<br/>
&gt; 4 inches. I will break them into stacks of about 1/4<br/>
&gt; inch thickness and take them to Staples to be<br/>
&gt; wirebound. That will give me a stack of  logbooks that<br/>
&gt; are perfect and will probably have cost less than<br/>
&gt; anything I could have purchased ready to go. I haven't<br/>
&gt; even been able to find the size of unlined notepad I<br/>
&gt; would like to use. Carving stamps is no biggie--it's<br/>
&gt; having logbooks that is my biggest obstacle to<br/>
&gt; planting!<br/>
