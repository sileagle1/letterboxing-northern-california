It's kind of a bit of work, but this is how I make my logbooks: <br>
I use a paper cutter to cut blank notecards to whatever size I need <br>
them to fit in a container, and then hole punch them and tie them <br>
together with a string.  Very cheap, and customizeable.  But, like I <br>
said, a bit of work.<br>
Good tip with the printer though!<br>
