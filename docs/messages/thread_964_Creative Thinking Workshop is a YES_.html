Let's shoot for Saturday, January 14, for the workshop. I'll start <br>
scouting out venues, although I'm pretty sure we can use some space <br>
in the Presidio's Visitor Center, home to the new White Star Cafe. <br>
(There's delightful irony in having this workshop on NPS territory, <br>
isn't there?) <br>
<br>
I'll bet that I'll run the same workshop for LbNY next year in the <br>
summer.... Ah! Upstate New York...!<br>
<br>
This morning, I found a long list of themes & inspirations that I <br>
used when I taught a class in improvational quiltmaking in Boston. <br>
The list is simply words that trigger images I find interesting, <br>
drawn from categories like Places, Styles, History, Legend, Ethnic <br>
Culture, the Arts, etc. [Spice Trade, Voodoo, Fireworks, Versailles, <br>
the Crusades, Art Deco, Totem Poles...) Just looking at the list <br>
generates images & ideas!<br>
<br>
On the list were several themes that have appeared in my <br>
letterboxes.Greek mythology, mazes, Atlantis, the moon, and the sun, <br>
are all on the old quilt list. Some are on my 'Boxes To Do' list <br>
(flea circus). <br>
<br>
I'll share my themes/inspirations list at the workshop, but you'll <br>
want to expand on it to include things that catch your interest -- <br>
one person I know will add Nancy Drew to her list.<br>
<br>
I'm glad I found this old list -- I can see about 50 - 60 potential <br>
box ideas right there!<br>
<br>
That's just one tiny aspect of the workshop. You all know about <br>
brainstorming, I'm sure. That's old hat, though, compared to <br>
creative thinking techniques such as Diabolical Genius, <br>
Transformative Thinking, and Parallel Worlds. (You know me by now -- <br>
I'm already busy marketing this workshop...)<br>
<br>
Another thing we'll do is call into question many underlying <br>
assumptions about what a letterbox is and consists of. Who knows <br>
what we'll turn up with -- some of our ideas will be totally whacky <br>
& impractical, but I'll guarantee you there'll be some major "AHA!s" <br>
that result in exciting new boxes.<br>
<br>
Long post, but hopefully informational...<br>
Ciao!<br>

> You taught a workshop in improvational quiltmaking in Boston!!!!!!!! <br>
Yes, and I also taught Color for Quilters. I stopped quilting when I <br>
moved here. The Improvisational Quilting class was great fun to teach.<br>
<br>
I have a major art quilt that's unfinished.I really turned on my <br>
creative thinking to come up with a design that would stand a chance <br>
of getting in a good juried national quilt show. It's a quilt within a <br>
quilt, and it's inspired by a music collaboration between Philip Glass <br>
and Ravi Shankar. (Angles and precise rhythms - Glass vs. circle and <br>
rings - Shankar) <br>
<br>
All the complex piecing is done, and every seam meets within a 1/16" <br>
tolerance! (1/8" is the national show requirement). This quilt is very <br>
large, and was meant to go from exhibit to exhibit. It's too large for <br>
most walls. It needs lots of hands to finish appliqueing the circles <br>
and rings. I was planning to have it hand quilted by one of the Amish <br>
services.<br>
<br>
Want to take over the applique work for me? Anyone interested in <br>
buying really cotton fabrics -- unique prints and solids?<br>
<br>
This is ALMOST off-topic,as we're not discussing Lb'ing. BUT after the <br>
workshop, you'll see relationships in lots of things. One of my nieces <br>
is also both a letterboxer and a quilter. Her personal stamp design is <br>
a quilt block.  <br>
<br>
So now you know about my quilting and possibly have figured out my 1st <br>
job...  but there are whole lot more things like those...<br>

Thanks! Yoder is a common Amish name. Now all I need to do is finish <br>
all that applique...<br>
