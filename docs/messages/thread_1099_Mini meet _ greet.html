I don't have any solid plans for that week yet.  I fly in on the night<br/>

Princess Lea is heading over to Dartmoor England tomorrow for 3 weeks of  <br/>
letterboxing (LUCKY!!) so we'll talk more when she returns. I'm sure Mimulus  <br/>
will be interested in joining us if she can. When you're about a  week out, send <br/>
us an email and we'll finalize plans. There's TONS of great  boxes up there!<br/>

I'm sure there are!  I want to snag some of the drive-bys that are at<br/>
the wineries in Santa Rosa and possibly see if I can get a morning to<br/>
myself to go do Jay Drew's series in the state park.  Sugarloaf<br/>
something...?  I was looking at it last night.  Anyone done that one?<br/>
 Jay's stamps out here in CT are fantastic.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, my uncle and I are going to see the Winchester House in San Jose<br/>
at some point, and he's a pretty fun guy.  He may take me to some<br/>
drive-bys there as well.  :)<br/>

Sugarloaf park has the Planet Walk series by Mimulus which is a wonderful 9  <br/>
box series but takes 3+ hours. There's another series there as well, <br/>
"Sideways".  . .something. And then there's the Drew's. We've gotten all the Planet <br/>
Walk  boxes and the first of the Drew series by the waterfall. You could <br/>
certainly  spend a couple of days in this park!<br/>
<br/>
As for the Winchester House, I've loved within 50 miles of it for most of  my <br/>
life and have never been there! Always sounded fun though.   <br/>

The Winchester Mystery House in San Jose is an unusual and interesting <br/>
place to visit.  Before or after you go, have your uncle take you to <br/>
the Rose Garden in San Jose.  There's a quick letterbox hidden there.  <br/>
And another couple of boxes are very close nearby in another <br/>
interesting locale.<br/>
