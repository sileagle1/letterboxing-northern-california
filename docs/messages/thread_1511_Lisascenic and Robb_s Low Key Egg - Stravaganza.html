out, and learn to decorate Ukrainian Easter Eggs.  I'll be hosting at<br>
Berkeley Rep's Scenic Studios, this Saturday at 2pm.  The address is<br>
2526 Wood Street in Oakland.<br>
<br>
This isn't really a letterboxing event, but I listed it on AQ, anyway.<br>
 Here's the link:<br>

<br>
This is a BYOB (bring your own blown egg) event.  At past Egg -<br>
Stravaganzas, people decorated between one and four eggs each.  We'll<br>
have a few eggs already blown, but I can't stomach a week of nothing<br>
but omelets, so if you can manage to blow your own, it would be a real<br>
help.<br>
<br>
The neighborhood is the warehouse district under the feet of the<br>
MacArthur Maze, kinda-sorta near the Home Depot.  It is a bit rough<br>
around the edges, so don't leave anything tempting sitting out in your<br>
cars.  Car pooling is probably a good idea, if you can manage that.<br>
<br>
Drop me a note, if you need more information.<br>
<br>
I hope to see you there!<br>
