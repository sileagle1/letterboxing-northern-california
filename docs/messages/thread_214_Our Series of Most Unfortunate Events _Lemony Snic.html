<br>
This is a tale of misery, and bad luck, if you are looking for <br>
someone to share their happy letterboxing experiences, stop reading <br>
now, do not read any farther, because the this clue will fill you <br>
with despair, this is your last chance, despair begins at the very <br>
next sentence.<br>
<br>
Those poor Baudelaire orphans! We tried to rescue them, tried, <br>
meaning of course, that we failed, but failed attempting to do it <br>
and not sitting on the couch at home watching T.V. and scarfing down <br>
cheetos. <br>
<br>
When we tried to leave Oregon for California, it seemed were plagued <br>
with the bad luck and misery of Sunny, Violet and Klause.  First the <br>
car broken down at the bottle of the hill, bottom at this point <br>
meaning the lowest part of a very large and miserable hill one must <br>
climb in order to get to the top.  Pandora was stranded.  A quick <br>
call to the Mechanic sent someone out to figure out what the problem <br>
was, a dead battery, no big deal, oh how wrong, the misery, agony <br>
and unpleasantness of trying to find a battery at 7:00pm on a Sunday <br>
night was about has bad has hiking through overgrown paths in Oregon <br>
where little bugs bite you merely to suck the blood out of you! When <br>
fixing this dilemma in our journey we were informed by the Mechanic <br>
who I am sure broke it on his own in an attempt to aid Count Olaf, <br>
that the alternator on the car was shot, shot meaning of course, not <br>
working at all.  So an overnight delay and the time it took to get <br>
that replaced in the morning set us way behind on our mission to <br>
rescue the miserable orphans. Once that problem was fix the <br>
following morning it appeared that the orphans bad luck and misery <br>
had worn off on us a bit, because when driving home to finally get <br>
on our way, we discovered that we could not tell what time it was or <br>
listen to music, which would surely make this trip even more <br>
miserable than we had imagined.  In investigating this problem we <br>
discovered that the car radio had put itself in theft lock mode when <br>
the battery died, and now required a secret code to unlock it.  <br>
Required meaning of course that it was absolutely necessary, and <br>
secret meaning of course that only the person that originally owned <br>
the car had it.  So delayed again, we headed to car toys to have the <br>
stereo replaced with one that would work, work from hear forward <br>
meaning it would play music that pandora could sing to in order to <br>
make the trip full of even more misery and agony for Iron`Bear who <br>
would have to listen.  We were finally on our way, headed, though <br>
terribly delayed, to California to rescue the orphans.  If there is <br>
a silver liningmeaning, of course, a sliver of hope that something <br>
good has come from such tragedy, it is that the $500 it took to get <br>
everything fix saved us from the car getting broken down in the <br>
miserable, hot area between Oregon and California where we would <br>
have been stranded on the side of the road and 50 miles out of any <br>
town.<br>
<br>
We finally arrived in California to find that there was a mistake in <br>
our hotel reservations that left us searching for a new hotel at <br>
2:30am  yet another most unpleasant experience.  But we finally got <br>
settled and slept, ready to wake up in the morning and finally <br>
attempt to rescue the poor orphans.  Sure enough we found the <br>
location where the orphans had been hiding, but much to our despair, <br>
no sooner had we found it than we saw Count Olaf himself breeze past <br>
us with the orphans in tow.  We were too late! Ahhh the misery and <br>
unpleasantness, the despair and broken heartedness we suffered was <br>
too much, too much meaning that neither of us could really handle <br>
it.  But it seemed there was a little ray of hope a note from <br>
Lemony Snicket in the back of the log book giving us a time and <br>
place to find more information about the orphans.  We rushed back to <br>
the car and headed straight to Kinko's where they charge you and arm <br>
and a leg to use their computers, in a hope to figure out where <br>
Lemony Snicket wanted us to go.  But alas, we could not decipher his <br>
directions.  <br>
<br>
We gave up for the day, filled with unpleasantness, and headed back <br>
to our room to clean up and have dinner with some local letter <br>
boxers. After that we visited family, which trust me fellow letter <br>
boxers, makes the whole adventure yet even more unpleasant.  <br>
<br>
The next morning we decided to go back to the location that the <br>
orphans had been at and take a picture of Lemony Snicket's letter in <br>
case it actually was a clue, and perhaps something we could un-<br>
riddle and figure out another time.  After grabbing a photo of the <br>
note, we decided to hit some much more happy and pleasant <br>
letterboxes and put an end to this series of unfortunate events that <br>
had befallen us on our quest for such an unhappy letterbox as the <br>
one planted by Lemony Snicket.  <br>
<br>
We hit several boxes in the area and finally found ourselves at a <br>
box in Oroville California.  We grabbed the box quickly in an effort <br>
to go expose ourselves to more misery by visiting family again.  We <br>
stamped in on a near by picnic table and then I rushed off to <br>
utilize a most unpleasant port-a-potty.  Iron`Bear re-hid the box <br>
and off we went.<br>
<br>
The next morning we had one last box to grab in Yuba City, before <br>
hitting the I-5 and heading home, nabbing a few boxes along the <br>
way.  We got to the park and I got out and started looking for the <br>
box, Iron`Bear was at the car getting the stuff. But he starts <br>
hollering to me, "pandora where is the book and stamp?"  "You had <br>
it last," I informed him.  After a few more minutes of him looking I <br>
walk over and he says, "I can't find it." That is when the worst of <br>
it all began. My heart sank to my knees; I felt a lump in my throat <br>
as I asked him. "When I rushed off to the bathroom last night and <br>
said, I'm going to the bathroom the stuff is on the table." Did you <br>
get the stuff?  Iron`Bear just looked at me, and shook his head, "No <br>
I didn't hear that part."  Oh the agony! The misery! The bad luck! <br>
The misfortune!<br>
<br>
We jumped in the car and immediately headed back to the park in <br>
Oroville; we searched frantically in a desperate attempt to recover <br>
even a smidgen of our journal.  But to no avail  it was gone, along <br>
with our signature stamp and a few of our dauber duos.  <br>
<br>
We sat in the car for a moment, staring off into nowhere, trying to <br>
figure out what to do, and I think, just understanding the <br>
disappointment and despair each on of us felt.  We had just lost not <br>
only the last 95 images we had collected, but also the last several <br>
series that we had planted, stamps that made all others we had <br>
carved pale in comparison.  <br>
<br>
But the worst of it all, the most dreadful, was that the journal <br>
contained both the Lemony Snicket stamps in Washington and <br>
California.  Iron`Bear and I looked at each other and decided we <br>
would figure something out.  Luckily for us most of the stamps we <br>
had our friends had gotten with us, we could color copy their stamps <br>
and only have to return for the ones that they didn't have.  But we <br>
had all those California stamps in there!  So we would get them <br>
back.  We made a mad dash through Oroville, Yuba City, Nevada City, <br>
Grass Valley, Auburn, and Willows and visited the Lemony Snicket box <br>
for a third time  retrieved every stamp we had gotten in the past <br>
two days, plus two more and then hit the I-5 had started making our <br>
way home.  However, even what we were able to accomplish didn't <br>
quite help the sting we felt, and we where sure now, that it was <br>
some evil plan of Count Olaf who was trying to keep us from having <br>
any evidence that the Orphans were ever there, and trying to destroy <br>
the image of him that we had gotten as he ran by with them in toe.  <br>
Why he had to take our entire book and signature stamp too we will <br>
never understand, but chalk it up to what an evil man he is.<br>
<br>
We write you dear fellow letter boxers and Mr. Snicket, to tell our <br>
tale of misery, despair, and tears and to warn all others that go <br>
for these letter boxes that they are quite well named, quite well <br>
described and really seem to instigate a series of most unfortunate <br>
events.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Iron`Bear and pandora{I`B}<br>
