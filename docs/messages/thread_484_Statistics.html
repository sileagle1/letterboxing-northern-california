                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Ryan for providing that link to Silent Doug's explanation page.  <br/>
Thought I'd mention that everyone does this their own way, and I don't <br/>
use exactly the same system that Doug describes.  For example, if a box <br/>
changes its stamp AND location, I count it as a new find.  Also, I only <br/>
count as a find a box where I have been able to swap images, so if the <br/>
box is there but the stamp is missing, I don't count it.  I also have a <br/>
list of "A" boxes, which is where I'm reasonably sure I've found the <br/>
correct hiding spot, but the box is gone (A=attempted).  Tara keeps a <br/>
list of "D" boxes - those that she has found in her dreams!  There's <br/>
also a new trend of Postal letterboxes, which I call PLB to distinguish <br/>
them from my regular P count.  And finally, I keep an S count - number <br/>
of states where I've letterboxed.  There are merit badges you can get <br/>
for almost all of these categories.<br/>
<br/>
You guys are so lucky - I don't think there were 100 letterboxes in all <br/>
of California when I started and it took me a long time to reach that <br/>
hurdle!  Keep on boxing, and I'll see you in April when we'll all <br/>
increase our X and E counts.<br/>

  It was 14 in California when we started, and now there is a target rich environment. <br/>
