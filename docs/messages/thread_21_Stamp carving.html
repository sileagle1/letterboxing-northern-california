We are new to letterboxing (six months) and we will be placing our<br/>
first box soon. I would like to carve the stamp, but dont know where<br/>
to get the stuff. Can it be as simple as cutting up a pink pearl<br/>
eraser? If someone knows where to get the stuff please let me know. I<br/>
dont like to shop on line much... I need the personal interaction. For<br/>
my first box I would like everything just so. Not that I'm anal or<br/>
anything.<br/>

You can try Michaels Art Supply stores for carving medium as well as speedball cutters. Unfortunately half the time their employees don't have a clue where to find what you want. Most of the time you will find that it is not in the stamp area, but in an area that has supplies for linoleum cutting.  They have some material on the shelves that frankly doesn't work very well , but some times you can find material that works great. Maybe someone else will jump in and post the various names or numbers of materials they use. While you seem not to want to buy on line, there is a very good supplier listed on our FAQS page, PZ Kut. They have material and speedball cutters and the material is easy to work with. I think it is a prerequisite for a letterboxer to be anal.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some Michael's stores have carving medium, but only their larger stores, and usually <br/>
the stuff is all nicked up.  I have had more success with true art supply stores, like <br/>
Amsterdam Art or The Art Store (don't know if there are branches of these in <br/>
Roseville).  As Don mentioned, everything is usually with the linoleum printing <br/>
supplies.  Once you find something you like, buying online will probably save you a <br/>
buck or two.  Happy carving!<br/>

Oh, boy.  You better watch out, because it'll suck you in.  The first <br/>
time I went into a Michaels it would simply for a little carving <br/>
material.  Next thing you know, I'm making my own soap, candles, <br/>
cross stitching, and...  well, you get the point.  It'll suck you in <br/>
and empty your wallet faster than you can imagine.  =)<br/>

Roseville....  that's near Sacramento, right?<br/>
