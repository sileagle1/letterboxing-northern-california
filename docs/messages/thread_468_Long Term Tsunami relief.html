I keep hearing the NGO types in Southest Asia saying they have tons <br/>
of supplies sittign on the tarmac (and they are very grateful)but  <br/>
probably wont have enought 6 months from now when they still need <br/>
help.  So here is my plug for Heifer international. They have a <br/>
great website and it is now a tradition in our family that for <br/>
birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  that we give a gift of an animal.  <br/>
Who needs more clutter sitting around gathering dust?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, consider starting such a tradition in your family.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heifer has learned that the CBS news show "60 Minutes," airing<br/>
this Wednesday, Jan. 12, at 8 p.m. ET/PT (7 p.m. CT), will<br/>
feature the inspiring story of Heifer recipient Beatrice Biira.<br/>
<br/>
In the segment, CBS Correspondent Bob Simon accompanies Beatrice<br/>
back to her home in Uganda to learn how an animal gift from<br/>
Heifer helped transform her family's life.<br/>

<br/>
What I'm getting from friends of mine who live in Sri Lanka and from other<br/>
friends in the region is<br/>
that the following two organizations are particularly helpful locally (and<br/>
long-term), and<br/>
have fewer overhead costs than the Red Cross:<br/>
<br/>
Sarvodaya - a Sri Lankan organization with an excellent track record - they<br/>
seem to be working on long-term needs already, which I appreciate. See their<br/>
website at<br/>
http://www.sarvodaya.org/<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
OXFAM <br/>
