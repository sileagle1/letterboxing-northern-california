year old daughter, who has never been off the East Coast before.<br/>
<br/>
What can you suggest for us to do if the weather is crummy?  I was <br/>
thinking of going tidepooling.  No major hiking involved for Robb, <br/>
lots of squishy invertebrates for us kids...  And if we get a bit wet, <br/>
it isn't a big deal.  Of course, at the rate we're going Route 1 is <br/>
going to soggily slip off the cliffs and end up in the beaches.<br/>
<br/>
What else is good and fairly close to Oakland/SF area?  <br/>
<br/>
Is the Jelly Belly factory tour worh the drive?  I fear that Scharffen <br/>
Berger's tour is a bit too "educational."  <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

Jelly Belly is a great place. There's the tour, the gift shop (pricy!) and  a <br/>
large snack bar/restaurant and plenty of photo ops, i.e., with Mr. JB in the  <br/>
front of the tour. No one is disappointed there but it would be a bit  of a <br/>
drive for you.<br/>
<br/>
You know, those poor people on the east coast may have lovely sunrises but  <br/>
rarely do they get a chance to see the sun SET over water, which happens to be  <br/>
one of MY favorite things in the world. How about dinner at the Cliff House  <br/>
or other sunset venue like Trader Vic's? <br/>

great one, especially if we get a nice day.  I'd like<br/>
to toss the Beach Chalet into the mix.  There is an<br/>
interesting display about San Francisco's past ont he<br/>
first floor and the restaurant is on the second floor.<br/>

I haven't been in a while, but the Metreon could be<br/>
kind of fun for a 14 yr old. There is a carousel,<br/>
bowling alley, ice skating rink (I think), sony store,<br/>
movie theatre and some other little shops.<br/>

The first two are inside and are the most fun. The other two are outside.  <br/>
Also, check out what Yerba Buena Center has to offer--there are all kinds  <br/>

for lunch, the steak salad (actually, all the salads) at Buckhorn (in the food  <br/>

Personally, I liked the chocolate tour better :-)<br/>

They have these rooms for  young kids for Birthday parties.  Kids running, yelling, screaming and just being annoying.  :) If she is 14 I don't know if she would like that part much.  The tour however was interesing when I went years ago.,  Check on that Choco factory because I have heard from several people about it planning to close down.  I don't know if it has. Some of the other ideas sound better and a little closer to home for you.  Plus if Robb gets tired easy even the tour might be tough.  They keep you walking and I don't recall any benches to sit a minute.  Good luck.  Come back and tell uswhat you ended up doing<br/>
