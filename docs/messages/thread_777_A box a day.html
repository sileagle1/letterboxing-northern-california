camping, kayaking, hiking, fishing, and letterboxing took a low <br/>
profile this trip.  In fact, i was so busy gettign everything ready: <br/>
gear, clothes, food, who will take care of the cirtters? stuff that <br/>
the letterboxing clue printing was somewhat of an after thought. <br/>
Mistake, since when I got there I realized I left at least one page at <br/>
home and only had the first bit for Day at VAlhalla, and the last bit <br/>
of FAllen Leaf Lake.  Anyway, I got to see the nursery where <br/>
arttrekkers artistic hand is evident and did nab MilkFarm.  <br/>
Unfortunatley we missed aT herself , but hope to be back in August. <br/>
<br/>
WE also got CAmp Richardson, and Boxes 1, 3, 5 of the I-80 Series.  <br/>
All great carvings by Old Blue and great locations, especially Box 3.  <br/>
<br/>
I can't believe in 13 years of living in CA I have never been to <br/>
Tahoe....I guess the horror stories about traffic I heard when I first <br/>
moved here scared me off driving I-80.  In fact I have studiously <br/>
avoided it and realized had never been furthur east than Auburn <br/>
before.  We always head up to Shasta, Lassen or the Trinities, but the <br/>
drivign was easy, the scenery great, teh fishing fantastic and now I <br/>
think I need to start training for high altitude hiking so I can get <br/>
the PAcific Coast series planted by Old Blue and Doublesaj last August <br/>
between Squaw valley and Sugar Bowl.  <br/>
