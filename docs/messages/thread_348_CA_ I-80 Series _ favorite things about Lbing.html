Auburn box and replace the full log book with a new one. <br/>
<br/>
I'll tell you, we're always trying to list, in order, the cool things we like <br/>
about letterboxing but after seeing all the great stamps including 'famous' <br/>
ones in our full log book, we have to move "finding a full log book in a box <br/>
you've planted" to the Number 1 spot! (Deciphering a particularly tough clue to <br/>
find the box moved to #2 and finding a hitchhiker is now #3).<br/>
