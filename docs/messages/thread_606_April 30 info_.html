we will have just taken a week vacation April 10-17 in<br/>
Bend, OR, then back to Santa Rosa on May 16; it's just<br/>
so much driving, but I want to come so bad. <br/>
 Thanks for all of the info. Hopefully I will be<br/>
meeting you in Sac soon!<br/>

&gt;   I think this is the 1st Sacramento gathering. <br/>
&gt; I've only been boxing<br/>

&gt; morning, doing exchanges<br/>
&gt;<br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.info/glossary/term.php?term=exchange)<br/>
&gt; &amp; passing<br/>

&gt; most of the<br/>
&gt; afternoon.  Finally meet back for awards, ice cream<br/>
&gt; &amp; goodbyes.  I don't<br/>
&gt; remember the exact schedule, but I'm pretty sure it<br/>
&gt; runs from 10-6.<br/>
&gt; There was talk of having some sort of demos (like<br/>
&gt; carving), but everyone<br/>
&gt; agreed we wanted the maximum time for boxing.  If<br/>
&gt; you look on the events<br/>
&gt; page at www.atlasquest.com, there's 24 people signed<br/>
&gt; up, &amp; I know some<br/>
&gt; there are others that have RSVPed that aren't on<br/>
&gt; that list.  Do you live<br/>
&gt; around Sacramento?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello!<br/>
&gt;  I wanted to thank everyone who gave me info abd<br/>
&gt; such about the <br/>
&gt; area. Sadly, we did not get much time to letterbox,<br/>
&gt; but we did <br/>
&gt; manage to get a couple of boxes. First we went to<br/>
&gt; Pacific Ridge <br/>
&gt; Oaks. It's at a winery, but we didn't make it all<br/>
&gt; the way up the <br/>
&gt; hill. The Sculpture Garden was really neat, and had<br/>
&gt; many trees to <br/>
&gt; keep up cool (since it was pretty hot for us, not<br/>
&gt; being used to the <br/>
&gt; heat). My 4 year old really enjoyed it too, but be<br/>
&gt; careful for <br/>
&gt; poison oak off the path. This box only had 3<br/>
&gt; visitors (counting <br/>
&gt; us)!? We enjoyed it! Thanks!<br/>
&gt;  We also went to the Healdsburg Quartet. This is a 4<br/>
&gt; series box. We <br/>
&gt; drove around since we were pressed for time. We did<br/>
&gt; stay at the <br/>
&gt; playground for awile; it was super cool! I really<br/>
&gt; liked the stamps <br/>
&gt; too! However box #3 was MIA. We still have plenty of<br/>
&gt; boxes to get <br/>
&gt; when we return to the area in May. Thank you!<br/>
&gt;  I was also wondering about the April 30 gathering<br/>
&gt; in Sacramento? <br/>
&gt; What happens there? I just started letterboxing less<br/>
&gt; than 1 month <br/>
&gt; ago, so I am really new. How big is the event in<br/>
&gt; Sacramento usually? <br/>
&gt; Just curious!<br/>
&gt; Thanks again,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The event is being held in Old Sacramento.  Currently there is only 1<br/>
box in Old Sac.  The plan is that a number of people will place boxes in<br/>
Old Sac within a few days prior to the event.  It's about 5 blocks long<br/>
&amp; 3 blocks wide, so everything will be walkable.  When they did a<br/>
gathering like this at Golden Gate Park, things were so spread out, I<br/>
think people only got a few boxes, so they wanted to keep this one<br/>
small.  Some of the boxes will be there only for that 1 day, some will<br/>
be left there after the event is over, some will be transplanted to a<br/>
new site afterwards.  There will also be an event stamp, a special stamp<br/>
carved just for this event that will not be available anywhere else.<br/>
