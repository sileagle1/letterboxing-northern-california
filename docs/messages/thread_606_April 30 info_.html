                    <div class="plaintext-content">The event is being held in Old Sacramento.  Currently there is only 1<br>
box in Old Sac.  The plan is that a number of people will place boxes in<br>
Old Sac within a few days prior to the event.  It's about 5 blocks long<br>
& 3 blocks wide, so everything will be walkable.  When they did a<br>
gathering like this at Golden Gate Park, things were so spread out, I<br>
think people only got a few boxes, so they wanted to keep this one<br>
small.  Some of the boxes will be there only for that 1 day, some will<br>
be left there after the event is over, some will be transplanted to a<br>
new site afterwards.  There will also be an event stamp, a special stamp<br>
carved just for this event that will not be available anywhere else.<br>
