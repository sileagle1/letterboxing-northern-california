<br>
IF you get your clues to me (that is, Hunter, the sec./treas. of Dorks<br>
Anonymous, member of dem xx men) BY SATURDAY NIGHT, 10:00 P.M., (TEN<br>
PEE-EM), I will put them in the zine with any accompanying pictures,<br>
logos, fonts, etcetera that you send as attachment or not to me at<br>
despues-mentioned email address.  <br>
<br>
IF they come at 10:01 p.m. or later, you are on your own to print,<br>
publish, or whatever is done to clues for gatherings (this being my<br>
first gathering, I have little concept of what that actually entails<br>
other than what Princess Lea has been so kind to explain...)<br>
<br>
I personally guarantee, as not only an arteest, but also as a teacher,<br>
who has worked hard on keeping promises to kids (and we all know how<br>
hard THAT is), that if you get anything to me by 10-ish on Saturday<br>
night, I will put it in the zine.  You can personally beat me with<br>
implement of your choice if they don't show up in the zine.  This zine<br>
is too kick-butt-ish to NOT publish, so it WILL be published.<br>
<br>
I WILL post a list to the listserve of what boxes/clues WERE published<br>
in the zine AFTER I have put it all together and printed the gosh-darn<br>
thing Saturday night (look for it 11:30 p.m.-ish or so).<br>
<br>
YOU can email ME at hmoonc@yahoo.com  to deliver clues and whatnot for<br>
the zine before that time or anytime in between, not to exceed 10:00<br>
p.m., Saturday, the 26th of August, 2006.<br>
<br>
Email me at hmoonc@yahoo.com or AQ mail me or send me a telegram<br>
("Dear Rolf...Stop...").  If you have questions/concerns/etcetera.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for completely reading the ramblings of of me.  Sincerely,<br>
