I mention that Amanda was out the day before the gathering?  We found I <br/>
Lost my Tarts in SF, Greener Pastures, The Frolicking Place, Go to the <br/>
Fault and Siempre Adelante - looks like we were a day behind Grinch &amp; <br/>
Grumpy on several of them.  Over the holidays I was down in the SLO <br/>
area and found Fore! (what a great walk) and Royal Cup.  Sleepy Cat and <br/>
I placed a bonus box from Fore! - the clues are written in the Fore! <br/>
log book and will not be posted online anywhere - just our little <br/>
secret!<br/>

By the way, does anyone know if it snows in Auburn?  Just wondering in <br/>
case there's an opportunity to get out that way.<br/>

Yes, it does on occasion, though as I understand it it's not often nor<br/>
does the snow stick for very long.<br/>

Ryan's right... it snows in Auburn maybe once a year and they're lucky if  it <br/>
stays 24 hours.... no worries mate!<br/>

Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I was also bummed that it was raining on Monday, since I had set <br/>
aside that day for letterboxing in the east bay. Today, the weather <br/>
is beautiful, but I can't manage a letterboxing trip! Bah!<br/>
<br/>
I'm also hoping the weather will hold on Friday, because that's when <br/>
I'm planning on going boxing - I'm having withdrawls, and I want to <br/>
get some boxes in before school starts next week! I'm also planning <br/>
on a trip down to SLO, so I'll be on the look out for the bonus box! <br/>
How exciting!<br/>
<br/>
And YES, I finally manged to plant my first letterbox: Go Spartans! <br/>
It's at San Jose State Univ. campus, and you can find the clues in <br/>
Letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com. I'm carving some stamps to plant <br/>
at Stanford; I'll be planting those next month.<br/>
<br/>
I had fun meeting all of you at the carving shindig - thanks, <br/>
blackbird, for having it at your wonderful art space, and thanks, <br/>
Princess Lea, for giving the demonstration!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year,<br/>
Cellissimo<br/>

You should be able to get to Auburn OK as it rarely gets snow. The log in our <br/>
box there was replaced recently (full). If you haven't gotten the Nevada City <br/>
and Grass Valley boxes, they should be OK to get too and only about 40 <br/>
minutes from Auburn up Hwy 49.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to get to letterboxing this weekend too. We WERE going to Tahoe but <br/>
too much snow!<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year, Lea!!<br/>

Hi Princess Lea,<br/>

<br/>
Some lovley boxes there, OH! look one is mine. LOL I'll keep an eye<br/>
out for you. Email me if you would like to have a quick exchange with<br/>
the wife and I.<br/>
