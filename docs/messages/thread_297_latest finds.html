like we've gotten a couple of feet out there! I'm so<br>
glad I escaped yesterday afternoon to Folsom to look<br>
for Diana's boxes ("Folsom" and "Folsom's Cohn Park").<br>
The first series took me on a lovely walk past a marsh<br>
replete with cattails and bird life. Her stamps are<br>
great and so are the convenient places to sit and use<br>
them.<br>
<br>
The second box in the second series gave me my first<br>
critter experience. It was a close encounter of the<br>
formicid kind! Yikes! I relocated the box a couple<br>
feet away, in hopes the ants would not follow, but<br>
future finders beware!<br>
<br>
Well, after all the press, I can't wait to get down to<br>
the coast and check out Alien for myself. It's not in<br>
the immediate future (especially if he is getting as<br>
much rain as we are snow!), but you never know when<br>
I'll just up and go.<br>
<br>
SO looking forward to SS's haunted house!<br>
