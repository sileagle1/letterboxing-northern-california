everyone had everything they needed.  Hopefully Steve &amp; Ben weren't too<br/>

hit any of the wineries for my wife, but we now know where they are for<br/>
next time.  <br/>

&amp; speaking of next time, I'll finally have a carved personal stamp Lea.<br/>
I've got my carving stuff with me here at work, so I'll be doing it<br/>
today at lunch.  I was holding off because I couldn't figure out what I<br/>
wanted it to be, but finally did last night.<br/>

<br/>
I got half way home and remembered that I forgot my hat. I will get it<br/>
someday, no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I had a great time meeting everyone and checking out all the stamps and<br/>
doing the exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
My stamp looks pretty bad compared to the others. The new boxes that were<br/>
place for the event were cool. Big thanks to Mimulus for opening her house<br/>
to us. Nice house BTW. As far as exchanging recipes, the lasagna came from<br/>
Costco. <br/>
