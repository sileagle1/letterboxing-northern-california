                    <div class="plaintext-content">Poor Robb, I keep dragging him letterboxing, when I think he would<br/>
probably be more comfortable resting.  He and I did the longest car<br/>
ride he's endured yet to go to the West Coast wedding reception-thingy<br/>
of two dear friends.  Up to this point, I don't think he'd been in a<br/>
car for much over half an hour, and we drove from Oakland to San Jose,<br/>
hitting those weird pockets of stop and go traffic that seem to happen<br/>
for no reason.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we (I) thought it would be fun to try to scoop up some<br/>
letterboxes on the way home.  But the fates conspired against us. <br/>
Bear am I was fenced off for some kind of festival (goodness knows<br/>
what the event was, drag volleyball tournament?????), and Maybe Next<br/>
Year was also un-approachable.  We got the Eye of Horus, but an over<br/>
zealous security guard kept us from Walking Like Egyptians.  We<br/>
enjoyed the Drive In, but although we figured out the location of the<br/>
Super Mystery, it was after hours, and we bagged it for another time.<br/>
<br/>
And this didn't actually happen in California, but it is too cool not<br/>
to mention:<br/>
<br/>
My friend Erica (my former Glimmerglass house mate) went letterboxxing<br/>
in Oriskany NY, and met Paul in SF's entire family.  She went to the<br/>
location of "The ______________, The Baker, the Candlestick Maker" and<br/>
the ____________ picked up the phone and the next thing Erica knew,<br/>
she was being introduced to all of Paul's relatives.  I've met his<br/>
Oriskany clan, and they're a delightful bunch.  They create great<br/>
letterboxes, too, I should add!<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I got a message that a brand new letterboxer named<br/>
tysonosaurus who found their first two letterboxes this weekend: my<br/>
Floral Depot and Good Fortune letterboxes!  They wrote:<br/>
<br/>
"Since it was the first one we'd found, I wasn't sure what to look for<br/>
and my heart started beating fast when I pulled it down. Totally felt<br/>
like some sort of spy in the city"<br/>
<br/>
Remember the thrill of your first letterbox?  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a nice weekend.<br/>

I do.. it was actually the GC/LB hybrid "Summer Beach Stamp" down in Santa<br/>
Cruz, but it was in such a neat place, it was definitely an event to<br/>
remember.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't have any time to do any boxing of my own this weekend, but waited<br/>
anxiously for a first find on my first plant... which came late this<br/>
afternoon from Jack Skellington.  No comments from him on the box, but I<br/>
hope enjoyed it.  I invited him to join this group and our potential<br/>
August gathering.  I must admit surprise that Anna &amp; the Kids didn't get<br/>
there first! :)<br/>

Hoping to do some boxing next weekend.   Wish things would stop being so<br/>
busy.<br/>

Sorry I didn't get to zoom in to find your box-- with<br/>
the end of school for the kids and a million little<br/>
things to do because of it, we haven't boxed for a few<br/>
weeks-- <br/>
<br/>
Wait though...  in a couple weeks it's all done and<br/>
you can bet we'll "just get out there and box!"<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see yours as well as all that wonderful<br/>
Santa Clara County activity in the past month...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to all--<br/>

No worries - I figured you were busy.  You're known to be the usual first<br/>
finder in these parts, so I was surprised,but I know you'll get around to<br/>
it as soon as you can. :)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun when you do get to get out, and hope to see you all at the<br/>
gathering in August!<br/>
