I went to check on my Sacramento Solons box &amp; I was very pleasantly <br/>
surprised to see that the box was hidden even better than I how I had <br/>
done it.  Thanks a lot to who ever added the bark pieces, they do a <br/>
great job.<br/>

Got the Old Sac box this morning with an HH to boot!<br/>

I like to think I'm in Old Blue's camp. There were<br/>
some bark pieces when I found the box, to which I<br/>
added more &amp; some grass clippings (they had just mowed<br/>
the lawn). I like it if I can hide the box entirely<br/>
(nothing showing) without making it look too<br/>
contrived. :-) aT<br/>

The day we visited it the gardeners had just passed through with the <br/>
mowers &amp; weedwhackers and it was very obvious that it didn't belong <br/>
there in its nook &amp; cranny--so we did our best to make it 'gardener <br/>
proof' knowing that they weren't finished working on the grounds.  <br/>
Thank rnrB &amp; trkr for the bark--they're pros at scrounging up <br/>
camouflage fodder for me.  It keeps them distracted when I'm <br/>
stamping in.  ;)  dvn2r ckr<br/>

Now looking back at the other posts from other visitors to this box <br/>
it looks like all the visitors added bits and pieces to it--<br/>
hopefully, it'll live a long &amp; uneventful letterbox life!  ;)  dvn2r <br/>

I too threw on a clump of grass clippings when I left.  Now I'm <br/>
worried there'll be a huge mound of bark &amp; grass soon ;)<br/>
