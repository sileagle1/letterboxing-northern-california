Hi Everyone!<br>
<br>
artTrekker here...I just wanted to formally introduce<br>
myself, even though I've already found a bunch of your<br>
great boxes and contacted some of you. I'm new to the<br>
group, and have only been boxing since September, but<br>
I'm nuts for it. I live at South Lake Tahoe and have<br>
been placing boxes as often as I can, but we just got<br>
a bunch of snow and I've been momentarily thwarted. I<br>
did place a series of four in Healdsburg and still<br>
don't know if they've been visited yet, so if you're<br>
hot on firsties, this might be a hot tip for you.<br>
Check out Holy Canoli Batman, while you're in the<br>
area. What a great art show! (Best to do a little<br>
web-surfing first.)<br>
<br>
Re: the kid who emailed Lea about dumping her<br>
box...that just cuts to the core. I've already had one<br>
box disappear & it bummed me out, so I went home and<br>
carved the stamp again and replaced it. It really is<br>
an act of trust to place these guys & I just wish the<br>
kid had had more curiosity than buttheadedness. In the<br>
end, it's just a shame & I think you just have to fall<br>
back on the karma answer. What goes around comes<br>
around. In the meantime, it gives us the opportunity<br>
to practice our carving and zen forgiveness.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I love haunted houses, too, and I don't think<br>
I'll be able to resist checking out Sierra Sally's.<br>
I'm starting to wonder if there's a 12-step program<br>
for boxers? Or maybe the only answer is to<br>
<br>
Box On!<br>

Welcome! <br>
First step is admitting that you have a problem. lol<br>
The next step is to get out and box! Keep on planting<br>
and have fun!<br>
