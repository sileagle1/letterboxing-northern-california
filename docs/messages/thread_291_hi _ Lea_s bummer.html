Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
artTrekker here...I just wanted to formally introduce<br/>
myself, even though I've already found a bunch of your<br/>
great boxes and contacted some of you. I'm new to the<br/>
group, and have only been boxing since September, but<br/>
I'm nuts for it. I live at South Lake Tahoe and have<br/>
been placing boxes as often as I can, but we just got<br/>
a bunch of snow and I've been momentarily thwarted. I<br/>
did place a series of four in Healdsburg and still<br/>
don't know if they've been visited yet, so if you're<br/>
hot on firsties, this might be a hot tip for you.<br/>
Check out Holy Canoli Batman, while you're in the<br/>
area. What a great art show! (Best to do a little<br/>
web-surfing first.)<br/>
<br/>
Re: the kid who emailed Lea about dumping her<br/>
box...that just cuts to the core. I've already had one<br/>
box disappear &amp; it bummed me out, so I went home and<br/>
carved the stamp again and replaced it. It really is<br/>
an act of trust to place these guys &amp; I just wish the<br/>
kid had had more curiosity than buttheadedness. In the<br/>
end, it's just a shame &amp; I think you just have to fall<br/>
back on the karma answer. What goes around comes<br/>
around. In the meantime, it gives us the opportunity<br/>
to practice our carving and zen forgiveness.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I love haunted houses, too, and I don't think<br/>
I'll be able to resist checking out Sierra Sally's.<br/>
I'm starting to wonder if there's a 12-step program<br/>
for boxers? Or maybe the only answer is to<br/>
<br/>
Box On!<br/>

Welcome! <br/>
First step is admitting that you have a problem. lol<br/>
The next step is to get out and box! Keep on planting<br/>
and have fun!<br/>
