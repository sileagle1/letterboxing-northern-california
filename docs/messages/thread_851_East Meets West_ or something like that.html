Robb and I are happily landed after a long cross country drive.  We <br/>
sure failed to find a lot of boxes en route!  Or, we found empties, <br/>
and boxes floating in bogs, or lots of nothing.  We did find a few <br/>
real cuties, though.  Milk Farm was a nice way to end the trip!  <br/>
<br/>
We planted a few Imaginary Roadside Attractions, one of which I <br/>
actually carved while riding at 80 miles per hour.  It didn't turn out <br/>
as sloppy as one might imagine...  I made the book in the car, too.<br/>
<br/>
When are you pulling your box, Paul?  I hope to scoop it up this <br/>
weekend, but it would be just my luck to arrive half an hour after you <br/>
had removed it.<br/>
<br/>
Robb waited almost twenty four hours before handing me directions and <br/>
sending me out to find his Cormorant Box.  I have to say, he made a <br/>
sweet little box.  The box itself is handmade, and quite charming.  <br/>
<br/>
Is anyone scheming or dreaming about another get-together?<br/>
