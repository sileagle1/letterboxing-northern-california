I seem to remember it being mentioned here....I think by Tara, not <br/>
sure what it is called but it has a website...<br/>
<br/>
You leave a book out somewhere (cafe, p[ark, airport) with the website <br/>
address and folk are invited to take the book, read it, post any <br/>
comments on the website and pass it on.<br/>

I believe you're thinking of Bookcrossing. I've done it once so far -<br/>
it's kind of exciting to see where the books end up (though mine was<br/>
never heard from again). <br/>
