<br>
If you have an account, please login to AtlasQuest and RSVP for the event<br>
- it helps us keep an accurate headcount, which is important since this is<br>
a potluck!  Also, if you plan to bring anything to share for the potluck,<br>
please check in with Team Tysonosaurus, who is keeping the master food<br>
list. :)<br>
<br>
The gathering is on Sunday, August 27 at Middle Harbor Shoreline Park in<br>
Oakland.  We'll start gathering around 10:30am, though I don't expect<br>
things to really get rolling until noonish, when we'll probably chow down<br>
and start stamping in.<br>
<br>
Can't wait to see everyone -<br>

Thanks for the reminder!  I hadn't intended to use the AQ list as the<br>
carved-in-stone headcount, but as a rough guide.  I do expect people who<br>
haven't RSVP'd there to show up - but it helps if people who are on AQ can<br>
RSVP anyway, just to give us a general idea.<br>
<br>
That said, our current AQ RSVP count (iirc) is at 40!  This is gonna be<br>
big! :)<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
