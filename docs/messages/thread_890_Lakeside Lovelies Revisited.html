Rather, we have replaced Blushing Butterfly in its usual place.  Our <br>
new Imaginarium is missing already. We have carved a new Pretty Posey <br>
and placed it in a new location.  So your visit to our Lakeside <br>
Lovelies has one old stamp and one new one.  Come on by before they <br>
empty the lake for the winter (for the last time.  The new nearby dam <br>
will negate the need for that in the future.)<br>
