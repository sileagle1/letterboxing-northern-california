How nice to find an email about my first letterbox when I got home<br>
from a very hard day at work. Whats better is that the note was from<br>
Funhog, the person who placed a box in my most favorite spot, and the<br>
first box we attempted to find. (unsucessfull due in part to lack of<br>
experience and part to a landmark being cut down). Thanks for the kind<br>
words.<br>

P.S. I hope to see you at a gathering or out on the trail so I may<br>
show you some of my better carvings.<br>

Dang! If the stamp at Lone Grave isn't one of your better carvings, I am looking <br>
forward to see those others. For anyone who hasn't seen this stamp or <br>
Letterboxspector's sig stamp, you're in for a treat... Funhog<br>
