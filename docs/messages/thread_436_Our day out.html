We took the opportunity of using the little available sunshine to go <br/>
find the survivors of Pearl Island yesterday.  Unfortunately we did <br/>
not get a very early start, so squandered most of the good weather.  <br/>
IT was looking like rain heading up the trail but we did  find Boxes <br/>
2 and 3.  If anyone is heading out to see those boxes anytime soon <br/>
BOx number 3 could use a new small, inner ziplock.  I could not get <br/>
it rezipped for the life of me....but the nifty tupperware as a good <br/>
tight fitting lid and everything was snug and dry.<br/>
<br/>
Box 1 eluded us although not for lack of trying, although we would <br/>
have tried longer had the rain not started on our way back.  We did <br/>
not persist since my 5 year old was not interested in LBing in the <br/>
rain, but I would have stayed out there till I was soaked. I flashed <br/>
on an image of me, age 95, out on the trail looking for an elusive <br/>
LB in the rain, catching pneumonia and that would be my end.   <br/>
<br/>
I am looking foward to visiting Sugarloaf to find the wonderful gift <br/>
box the Alien Explorers left for me.  Thanks AE Team for the good <br/>
press on Planet Walk.  IT is such a beautiful park more people <br/>
should visit (and not alot of poison oak!)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails, <br/>
Mim<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Bootzoocrew for piquing my interest for Lemony Snicket, I <br/>
will go reserve the book at my local library. If you read this <br/>
before leaving to box on New 'Years and are coming to SoCo you can <br/>
go hwy 121 to 12  over to 101 via ARnold Drive/Warm Springs/Bennett <br/>
Valley.  You could hit the Glen Ellen winery boxes, Ma-ki-la, Brine <br/>
Country boxes which are short walks or drivebys.  Once on 101 you <br/>
can scoot North to Healdsburg, take a side trip for Batman, then <br/>
head further south to PEtaluma for Grafitti and contine back on 121 <br/>
or is it 116?  back to Napa and then Vallejo.  <br/>

Hey Michelle, I must have been just behind you yesterday when you were <br/>
taking hte PLB on an outing.  We saw your stamp at Sandlot...withthe <br/>
note...but hoped to see the PLB in Sandlots logbook...was it the eagle?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway that was a great park and we stayed about 2 hours, practicising <br/>
our boomerang throw and sliding down the cement slide.  We also tried <br/>
for Princess Lea's Witchypoo and Every Flavor Beans and although I am <br/>
pretty sure we had the right spots...no boxes either place.  It looked <br/>
like someone had been looking for Witchypoo as well, several <br/>
overturned rocks, but that could have been the rain.  Lets all <br/>
remember the leave no trace ethic.  <br/>
<br/>
A very fun day out, however even though skunked on two boxes. The <br/>
facotry tour at JB was great. And I have never had reason to check out <br/>
Benecia before. I thought it was charming.  My son I wandered around <br/>
downtown and had a picnic at thelittle waterfront park near <br/>
Witchypoo.  <br/>
<br/>
And for all you roadside diner foodies here is a good tip for road <br/>
trips to NApa.....the Boon Fly Cafe on Hwy 12/CArneros Hwy between <br/>
Napa and Sonoma.  It looks sophisticated and is definitely not a <br/>
greasy spoon...but very casual...everyone in jeans.  Open for B, L, <br/>
and D.  Great food and reasonably priced for the quality of dining. A <br/>
tanker had spilled 2000 gallons of wine on the HWy a few miles ahead <br/>
and traffic made us stop for dinner. Don't you just love those <br/>
serendipitous finds?  <br/>

I guess I forgot to make the post about Witchypoo - its remains were <br/>
found by my sister-in-law's sister when she was out letterboxing.  Her <br/>
little girl found the logbook (completely soaked from the rains) and <br/>
some bits of plastic bag.  I'll try to replant some day - I have always <br/>
wanted to get back to the area and do a Mothball Fleet box.<br/>
<br/>
Every Flavor Beans should still be there - it is one of the most <br/>
popular boxes I have.  It should well hidden in the undergrowth and <br/>
even I have had trouble locating it when doing box maintenance.  Will <br/>
keep you all posted if there are any future finders, or if this box has <br/>
finally gone the way of the dodo.  I have had a bad month in terms of <br/>
losing boxes (or at least reports of losing boxes).  FYI, I have heard <br/>
that Crab Cove (#1), Tightwad Hill, The Lion King and Summer of Love <br/>
are MIA.<br/>

I too had a tough time with Every Flavor Beans.  I stood in the pouring rain for more than 15 mintues trying to find it, going back to the car to read clues about 5-6 times.  I figure it has to be that well hidden with all the gardeners coming through.<br/>
