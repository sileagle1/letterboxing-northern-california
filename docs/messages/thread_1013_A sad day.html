                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was very sad to see the owner of Paradise Ridge winery was hit by a <br/>
car last night and died while crossing Old Redwood Hwy on foot.  Some <br/>
of you may remember I have a letterbox hidden at the winery and was a <br/>
frequent visitor of the sculpture garden there.  Also, we were wine <br/>
club members and often spoke to Marijke Byck-Hoenselaars when picked <br/>
up our wine each month.  She was a wonderful lady who worked <br/>
tirelessly on behalf of the homeless, the food pantry and the foster <br/>
children's shelter.  She will be sorely missed.  <br/>
<br/>
We did get water in our garage and under the foundation at our <br/>
house...I have never seen so much rain in 13 years of living here. I <br/>
am preparing to install french drains instead of carving and planting <br/>
boxes for hte next few weeks.  Stay safe and dry everyone and look <br/>
both ways when you cross the street in pursuit of that box.  <br/>
