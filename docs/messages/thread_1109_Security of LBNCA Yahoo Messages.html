<br/>
I ran the following words and phrases, and got no hits relating to<br/>
this Yahoo forum:<br/>
<br/>
Lost Sea Maiden<br/>
Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue<br/>
Princess Lea<br/>
Knitica (this was to cross-check with the LBNY Yahoo group)<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, there is a "boxer" named Princess Lea mentioned on the<br/>
internet.  She's a dog recued by a Boxer Rescue Orgainzation.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think our conversations about letterboxing are safe for the moment.<br/>

You do all the testing you wish, and all the posting of your own <br/>
personal information that you like, but please do not encourage others <br/>
to do the same. You may not be able to retrieve information, but it is <br/>
archived in such a way that it is easily retrieveable. While my post <br/>
was certainly worthy information that should be considered as such, if <br/>
you choose to ignore it so be it. <br/>

this should go to Dogpile, and type in their home phone number. Once <br/>
that is done click on your name and that brings up the map to your <br/>
house.(There is a method you can use to block this function) Now for <br/>
very little expense you can receive more detailed info from a web <br/>
based info company. Cell numbers, PO Boxes can be broken as well.<br/>
<br/>
Then try typing in your name at Dogpile, or trail name with <br/>
letterboxer behind it. There are some folks that have quite a bit of <br/>
information posted on the internet and that can be accessed with or <br/>
without using the letterboxing add on. Work places, other <br/>
hobbies,memberships to other groups can be ascertained fairly easily.<br/>
<br/>
While I did not find any LbNCA posts, there were several from LBNY <br/>
that was available.I probably could have found the LbNCA posts with <br/>
a little more digging.<br/>
<br/>
A friend and fellow investigator obtained Rebecca Scheafer's address <br/>
from her license plate years ago for his client, so I am a little <br/>
paranoid when it comes to having information too accessable. His <br/>
life changed when her life was ended.<br/>
<br/>
 Why not be a little more cautious when using chatlists?<br/>

  I tried both your Dogpile tests and ended up removing my listing from<br/>
  their White pages site. Testing my trail name brought up many listings<br/>
  involving my input on various boxes. I was just reading an article where<br/>
  someone was working on a cold murder case and found the guy who did<br/>
  it through classmates.com. That would be a beneficial use of such info,<br/>
  but I'm sure there are plenty of stories of abuses.<br/>
<br/>
  I don't like to go through the world in fear, but I also don't want to be<br/>
  stupid and make it easy for those abuses to happen to me. I very much<br/>
  appreciate your background in security and your looking out for us.<br/>

Hi Kel, <br/>
Caution is the only thing I'm preaching. When you have a choice <br/>
about posting information it is best to err on the caution side. If <br/>
anyone wishes to ignore my input, that is now an 'informed' choice.<br/>
Investigators used to use a technique called 'dumpster diving', and <br/>
I have done my share of that, but today the 'dumpster diving' is <br/>
done on the computer.<br/>
Information comes from many areas that you think is innocent.<br/>
I once found a deadbeat dad by ascertaining that he was a league <br/>
bowler. League bowlers are nationally registered and that info today <br/>
may have a few obsticles in the way of obtaining it, they are only <br/>
minor obsticles. Any information about anyone can be found given <br/>
sufficient time and money, including a real picture of a real <br/>
drivers license.<br/>
<br/>
FYI,I liked your Drivers License picture, but you must have had a <br/>
bad night?<br/>
