enough of the work--you carved the stamp and wrote the clue and <br>

My method of counting placed stamps is probably flawed, but I like <br>
it because it's relatively clear cut and means I don't have to make <br>
as many murky counting choices.  So I just assume the literal: It <br>
counts as a "placed" if you PLACED it.  =)<br>

You're just messing with us; you know how LBs are normally placed, <br>
but you're pushing the envelope.  I say these are your letterboxes.  <br>
Think of painting, of Andy Warhol (or Rubens for that matter); he <br>
directed the creation of his paintings, he designed them, he came up <br>
with the original idea, but someone else actually applied the paint <br>
per his explicit instructions. He signed them.  They are his <br>
paintings; these are your letterboxes. <br>

<br>
Here's my take: There are lots of active letterboxing "teams" and partners, <br>
and when they plant a box, each member of the team counts it as a P, <br>
regardless of how they shared the tasks involved (as long as they all <br>
participated in some way). Since your box was a "joint production" and <br>
couldn't have happened without the participation of you both, I say you <br>
each can count it as a plant.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I knew that when I asked this question I'd get a whole variety of <br>
responses - it does seem that each individual letterboxer makes up <br>
their own rules as they go along.  I'm glad to hear that there are <br>
other teams out there who each count the boxes on which they <br>
collaborate.  So I will probably go with 2 each or 1 each - Amanda, <br>
what say you?  Amanda did work very hard on her end, which included <br>
dragging her ninety-something year old grandmother around to a <br>
multitude potential planting spots around Virginia.<br>
<br>
On a different note, I am planning on replanting my Crab Cove letterbox <br>
today.  It's a different stamp than the original, and it will be in a <br>
slightly different place, but near to the old one.<br>
<br>
Also welcome to all the new subscribers to the Northern California <br>
Letterboxing list!  Invitations have been going out to the locals and <br>
response has been quite good so far.<br>
