son (5) and 2 nieces (3 &amp; 7) just last week- we're hooked!  I haven't <br/>
carved a stamp yet &amp; the kids are too small for an exacto knife, but <br/>
the kids and I used foam stickers and our own cutouts from foam sheets <br/>
to make each of us a stamp.  We got our logbooks and off we went!  I <br/>
was worried that they would lose interest when we couldn't find the <br/>
first one we tried, but all that was forgotten when we found Bear Am I-<br/>
 they (and I) were SO excited!  We've picked up three more stamps <br/>
since then.  Thanks so much to eveyone who has taken their time and <br/>
talent to create and plant these boxes!  We're hoping to add one of <br/>
our own soon.<br/>
<br/>
I have a letterboxing etiquette question, though-  I have tried to <br/>
minimize the space we take up with our stamps (since there are 4 of <br/>
us) by using both sides of a page, but I was worried that it might be <br/>
considered "bad manners" for a group to add individual stamps...should <br/>
I be working on a single family stamp?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, in advance, for your input!<br/>
