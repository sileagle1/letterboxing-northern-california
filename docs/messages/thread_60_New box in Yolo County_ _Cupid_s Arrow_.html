Cherub, the Prince of Love, Cupid.  Cupid is all about love, we know <br/>
that. But hitting the target requires accuracy, aim, trajectory. That <br/>
means practice. You wouldn't want your sister falling goo-goo-eyed in <br/>
love with that weird guy next door! Find Cupid's Arrow and you'll <br/>
see, first-hand, where the little guy does his practicing. Who knows, <br/>
you just might spy him behind a tree! By the way, Cupid is never seen <br/>
here after dusk.<br/>
<br/>
Go south on Mace Blvd. Leave the residential area, pass a Campbell <br/>
Soup sign, levee, bridge, about 4 miles all told. Watch for the Yolo <br/>
County Grassland Regional Park, "The Oasis" entrance. "No Broadheads, <br/>
No Crossbows" marks your path. Wend your way through this <br/>
interesting, shady place to target area number 8. Footbridge, east <br/>
side, underneath about 3 feet from the edge.  <br/>
