<br/>
We managed to get up to Nevada City today and, after some serious <br/>
clue deciphering, were able to be first finders for the Lone Grave <br/>
LB!<br/>
<br/>
This is an absolutely gorgeous handcarved stamp placed by a newcomer <br/>
to our ranks, and is definitely one not to be missed!<br/>
<br/>
Be prepared to think a little outside the normal clue lines in order <br/>
to find this one! Also, brown and red seem to be fitting stamp <br/>
colors!<br/>
<br/>
For anyone (Doublesaj perhaps??) that was planning on getting this <br/>
one, make sure you check the clues as they have been revised!<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, we picked up our 16th HH as a bonus! The Black Cat is now <br/>
on its way to...he heh he!<br/>
