                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've had some ideas for box locations that I wanted some input on.<br/>
First is kids' parks, some of which actually require you to have kids<br/>
with you to enter.  I'm somewhat unsure of posting clues on an<br/>
international database to encourage strangers to hang around kids areas.<br/>
Especially since a registered pedophile was recently arrested hanging<br/>
around the kids' pool at my daughter's favorite park.  Not that I would<br/>
ever suspect any letterboxer of anything so vile, but with the totally<br/>
wide open internet community, you can never know.  Also, I'm worried<br/>
about encouraging boxers to go for a box that might put them in a<br/>
compromising situation.  "Mommy, why is that strange man without a kid<br/>
carrying that big bag &amp; digging around in those bushes."  OTOH, being a<br/>
letterboxing parent always looking for places to box with my daughter, I<br/>
thought a series in a kids park would be a great idea.  Of course, as I<br/>
was typing this, I realized I could post the box series without the<br/>
clues &amp; require a personal reference to get the clues, but then I'd feel<br/>
like I was being too exclusionary.  Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
My second idea for a location would require the box to be hidden up<br/>
pretty high.  Being 6'3", I'm able to reach it easily, but anyone much<br/>
under 5' wouldn't be able to.  &amp; there's nothing to stand on to get it.<br/>
Again, don't want to be exclusionary, or "height-ist", but did seem like<br/>
a good place for hiding.  Has anyone seen any other boxes with physical<br/>
requirements like that, other than maybe being in good enough shape to<br/>
hike a long way?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

This might be a problem. If folks sans kids would ignore the box <br/>
that would be okay, but if they try to go find it then there could <br/>
be a big flap.  <br/>

Exclusionary isn't a bad thing, not everyone needs to find every box.<br/>

We had a box in El Dorado Park(squirrels finally kicked us out) that <br/>
we advised in the clues to bring a step ladder or something else to <br/>
stand on. That was for those less than 6 ft. Here again don't worry <br/>
about exclusionary. We have a few letterboxes that you can reach by <br/>
whitewater raft or kayak and those would be much more difficult than <br/>
those with height requirements. As long as you make it clear in your <br/>
clues the different aspects of the box location I think that nearly <br/>
anything goes. I noticed that Ryan has even added an "Extreme" <br/>
classification on his site. I guess that would be for rock climbing <br/>
locations, and there would be very few letterboxers that have <br/>
climbing gear.<br/>

<br/>
Having kids along to enter would be a plus for these Grandparents.  <br/>
We're always on the lookout for boxes to share with our littlest <br/>
family members.  They are left out of so many things that lots of <br/>
older people get to do, so it would be fun to require <br/>
their "assistance" for some letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My second idea for a location would require the box to be hidden up<br/>
&gt; pretty high.  <br/>
<br/>
We have climbed trees (correction: Grumpy has climbed trees) 2 or 3 <br/>
times in search of letterboxes.  The clues usually contain a hint so <br/>
we were prepared in advance for a physical challenge.  It just adds to <br/>
the greater satisfaction when the box is found.<br/>
