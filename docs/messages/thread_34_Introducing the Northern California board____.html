                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since no new votes have come in about the poll for the last week or <br>
so, I've officially ended the poll about what to do with this board.  <br>
Most voters preferred turning this into a Northern California board, <br>
so that is what I will do.<br>
<br>
More accurately, this board would probably be better called "The Rest <br>
of California talk list"--everywhere not included by the Southern <br>
California talk list, but for simplicity in naming, I'll just stick <br>
to "Northern California".  I visualize this board's "boundry" as <br>
being everywhere north of Santa Maria (San Luis Obispo County on <br>
up).  Roughly speaking, areas 1 through 6 on the California map of <br>
the LbNA website.  The Sierra Nevadas, San Jauquin Valley (I screwed <br>
up the spelling of Jauquin, didn't I?), Central Coast, and everywhere <br>
north of those.<br>
<br>
In case lots of people have bookmarks to this site, I plan to change <br>
the URL from LbCA to LbNCA to reflect the change.  I'll give it a <br>
week or so people will be prepared when the current URL suddenly <br>
stops working and the new one takes affect.  I'll also make a post <br>
when I make the change, and mark the message as a "Special Notice" so <br>
those that have signed up for individual e-mails or special notices <br>
will know exactly when the change occurs.  As a result, anywhere you <br>
now see "LbCA" from e-mail addresses to URLs will change to LbNCA.  <br>
(I had considered changing it to LbNC, but then figured it would <br>
seriously confuse anyone from North Carolina!  Those Nebraska people <br>
are probably knocking their heads now with the LbNE talk list having <br>
nothing to do with Nebraska.)<br>
<br>
Don & Gwen: I know you wanted a single California board (as did I--<br>
which is why I created this board in the first place!), but the <br>
people have spoken.  I'd bet a similar poll on the Southern <br>
California talk list would have gotten similar results.  Your idea of <br>
trying a single board for six months might work, but I'm not inclined <br>
to "fight the masses".  If you can talk everyone on the SoCal board <br>
to move over here and give it a try for a few months, I'm okay with <br>
that.  If, after the introductory period, they decide that a single <br>
talk list for California would work, I'd be happy to turn this back <br>
into an "All California" board once again and let California Bear <br>
take the reigns.  I doubt it'll happen--people don't like change, and <br>
they'll prefer their own little place to chat.  But I've been wrong <br>
before and will be happy to work with you on that--if you can <br>
convince them to give it a try.<br>
<br>
I think that pretty much covers all the bases.  For now, at least.  <br>
I'm sure I'll think of some detail I've forgotten to mention, but <br>
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.<br>

And by the way, I think area number 5 on the California map belongs <br>
to SoCal, because we're not giving up Don & Gwen in Kernville without <br>
a fight--a whole bunch of their boxes are planted down here!! And the <br>
Central Coast (#6) may yet be up for grabs. I know you googlers have <br>
a pact in blood, but a few of us SoCal-ers have made some friends up <br>
there, and who knows what the future will bring.<br>

Oh, heck, take 'em!  See if I care!  ;o)<br>
<br>
But seriously, I figure Kernville should be in SoCal if for no other <br>
reason than Don & Gwen do more boxing activity in that area than in <br>
Northern or Central California.  And rather make them pay close <br>
attention to both boards, they can put most of their focus on one <br>
and check this one less often.<br>
<br>

<br>
Now the Central Coast is definitely part of this board!  You SoCal <br>
folks didn't want it in the first place, and so you're not going to <br>
have it now.  So there!  ;o)<br>

Actually, we used chocolate syrup, but close enough....<br>

We are going to continue to receive both lists just to make sure that we can monitor any dead horse beatings. FYI we finally figured out a date for a letterboxer get together here in Da Ville, so put April 24 th on your calendar. The river should be up, and that should entice those that want to do some white water and some white water letterboxing. Ryan, there are a couple of climbing walls and a practice area "The Slab" that should get you some practice for that tree letterbox too. Don<br>
