Raggs,<br/>
  I saw your stamp in the Sacramento City Cemetery.  Did you go on <br/>
Saturday?  I signed in on Saturday the 8th at 8:15AM &amp; your stamp was <br/>
also dated 1/8.  Did I just miss you by 15 minutes?  Too bad if I <br/>
did.  I drove around to see if you might be still in the cemetery, <br/>
but didn't see anyone that wasn't working there.<br/>
