&gt; &gt;    Hi all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I went ahead and reserved Area C at MHSP for Sunday, August 27, for $72.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This does have a BBQ pit and there will be a BBQ!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Someone needs to be at the site between 10-10:30 am to physically claim<br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the day. Nobody will be there to do it for us and there is nowhere<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; check in, we just need to be there by then to stake the claim. We don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; need to figure out right now who that should be, but if anyone wants to<br/>
&gt; &gt; volunteer, that's fine too. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I want to stress again that I don't think anyone should feel obligated<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; pay as part of attending this event. I think one of the great things<br/>
&gt; &gt; about Letterboxing is that participation doesn't require dues, fees, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; lots of expensive equipment; another is that it has a vibrant community<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; people who enjoy coming together and doing things for each other, such<br/>
&gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; giving advice, planting letterboxes, and manning the grill! I will pass<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hat and ask participants to give if they can, but not to feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; obligated. I don't want to presume upon anyone's financial situation or<br/>
&gt; &gt; make anyone feel as though they cannot participate, and I feel certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; that things will balance out anyway.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I also agree with the idea of divvying up any remaining money to<br/>
&gt; &gt; reimburse<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone who laid out a lot on the potluck, such as for grillables,<br/>
&gt; &gt; plates/napkins/etc, or whatever else we determine appropriate.. I'm sure<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; it'll work out when we get there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kathy, when you get a chance, we'd still like to see the menu so far! I<br/>
&gt; &gt; haven't yet committed to bringing anything and I'd like to see what is<br/>
&gt; &gt; still needed. Thanks!<br/>

I think I was the first to offer to bring something and signed up for<br/>
brownies and cookies again, like I brought to the GRR.  I promised to<br/>
have plenty for all, but by all means, bring something gooey.  Gooey<br/>
is my favorite kind of dessert, but I most always bake brownies and<br/>
cookies because they can be baked ahead, are easier to transport and<br/>
usually hold up to the elements better.  <br/>

potluck food! :)<br/>
<br/>
Sign me up for some simple fruit salad; I was also considering making <br/>
cupcakes.  What else do we need?  How about side-dish snacky things?  <br/>
I'm a big fan of hummus and pita chips, so I'll plan on bringing that too.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see you all!<br/>

&gt; Wait, you are on the list! Perhaps putting your pasta salad first threw us<br/>
&gt; off track...<br/>

swarms of gigantic bloodlusty mosquitoes in the heat. <br/>

I will be at the gathering, -- it's right before my trip to Romania <br/>
on the 31st.<br/>
<br/>
FOOD: I will bring a vegetarian appetizer called, "Cowboy Caviar".<br/>
<br/>
It's a "faux caviar" made with chopped black olives and black beans, <br/>
flavored with a cumin/lime/garlic marinade, over cream cheese. You <br/>
scoop it up with tortilla chips. <br/>
<br/>
SOME NEWS: LbNY (which I founded 2 yrs. ago)just celebrated its 2nd <br/>
anniversary with a small gathering. It's grown to just over 100 <br/>
members! Like LbNCA, it's also a friendly, cooperative, helpful <br/>
group. <br/>
(lisascenic is also a LbNY member, as some of you know)<br/>
