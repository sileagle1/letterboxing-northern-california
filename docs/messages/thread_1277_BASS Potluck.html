I think I was the first to offer to bring something and signed up for<br>
brownies and cookies again, like I brought to the GRR.  I promised to<br>
have plenty for all, but by all means, bring something gooey.  Gooey<br>
is my favorite kind of dessert, but I most always bake brownies and<br>
cookies because they can be baked ahead, are easier to transport and<br>
usually hold up to the elements better.  <br>

Sign me up for some simple fruit salad; I was also considering making <br>
cupcakes.  What else do we need?  How about side-dish snacky things?  <br>
I'm a big fan of hummus and pita chips, so I'll plan on bringing that too.<br>

Valley to visit family, and letterbox with them while swatting at <br>
swarms of gigantic bloodlusty mosquitoes in the heat. <br>
<br>
I will be at the gathering, -- it's right before my trip to Romania <br>
on the 31st.<br>
<br>
FOOD: I will bring a vegetarian appetizer called, "Cowboy Caviar".<br>
<br>
It's a "faux caviar" made with chopped black olives and black beans, <br>
flavored with a cumin/lime/garlic marinade, over cream cheese. You <br>
scoop it up with tortilla chips. <br>
<br>
SOME NEWS: LbNY (which I founded 2 yrs. ago)just celebrated its 2nd <br>
anniversary with a small gathering. It's grown to just over 100 <br>
members! Like LbNCA, it's also a friendly, cooperative, helpful <br>
group. <br>
(lisascenic is also a LbNY member, as some of you know)<br>
