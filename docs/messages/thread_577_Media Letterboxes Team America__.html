I know what you mean about the theme song, Lea, I've always got that thing in my head.  Too bad its R-rated so you can't sing it out loud, but thats the main part of what makes it so funny.  Can't wait for that one to come out on DVD!<br>

I haven't watched South Park much myself, but I did see the one where <br>
Robert Smith from the Cure was on the show (he was some kind of god who <br>
came to save the world??) - that is pure genius.  Plus, I also thought <br>
Team America: World Police was hilarious - not a movie for everyone, <br>
but I could not stop singing the theme song all week (unfortunately <br>
it's R-rated and I cannot repeat it here)<br>
