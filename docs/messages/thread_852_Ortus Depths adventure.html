we had limited time to look and were looking in kind<br/>
of the wrong spot on our first try-- (the directions<br/>
are fine-- it was our stupidity...)  There was a<br/>
"mature" heavy-set woman doing her acrobat stretching<br/>
routine in the spot where we were sure we needed to<br/>
look.  Turns out she needed to "stretch" on every lap<br/>
of the walk she took and a mighty attractive routine<br/>
it was (we got to witness this 5 minute spectacle no<br/>
less than a half dozen times!!)--- especially the part<br/>
where she was reach-reach-reaching for her toes with<br/>
her backside to us.  She was suspicious of our<br/>
disappearing and reappearing act each lap too-- much<br/>
stink eye was given.  We ran out of time and had to<br/>
give up.<br/>
<br/>
On return the next day, that woman was BACK!!!  She<br/>
was doing the same routine!!!  Thank goodness we<br/>
figured out that we were in the wrong spot and<br/>
backtracked to the right spot-- only had to witness<br/>
three bendovers!!<br/>
<br/>
Kinda cool place though-- stamp is definitely worth<br/>
it--  Enjoy your vacation--<br/>

&gt; &gt; I had some<br/>
&gt; &gt;  difficulty at Ortus Depths because the place was<br/>
&gt; CRAWLING with trail<br/>
&gt; &gt;  volunteers. They were from the Gap (matching<br/>
&gt; t-shirts) and I think<br/>
&gt; &gt;  there were 100s of them. Literally. I hunted<br/>
&gt; around the best I could<br/>
&gt; &gt;  but I never did find the Lions - but that might<br/>
&gt; be because there were<br/>
&gt; &gt;  volunteers blocking them from view.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never mind, I figured out what I did wrong and now<br/>
&gt; know where the Lions <br/>
&gt; are - guess it would have been pretty hard to miss<br/>
&gt; them, if only I'd <br/>
&gt; been in the right place!  I was down by the<br/>
&gt; natatorium - silly me.  By <br/>
&gt; the way, has anyone attempted Semper Fi lately? <br/>
&gt; It's down in that area <br/>
&gt; of town also.<br/>
