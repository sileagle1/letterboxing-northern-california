we had limited time to look and were looking in kind<br>
of the wrong spot on our first try-- (the directions<br>
are fine-- it was our stupidity...)  There was a<br>
"mature" heavy-set woman doing her acrobat stretching<br>
routine in the spot where we were sure we needed to<br>
look.  Turns out she needed to "stretch" on every lap<br>
of the walk she took and a mighty attractive routine<br>
it was (we got to witness this 5 minute spectacle no<br>
less than a half dozen times!!)--- especially the part<br>
where she was reach-reach-reaching for her toes with<br>
her backside to us.  She was suspicious of our<br>
disappearing and reappearing act each lap too-- much<br>
stink eye was given.  We ran out of time and had to<br>
give up.<br>
<br>
On return the next day, that woman was BACK!!!  She<br>
was doing the same routine!!!  Thank goodness we<br>
figured out that we were in the wrong spot and<br>
backtracked to the right spot-- only had to witness<br>
three bendovers!!<br>
<br>
Kinda cool place though-- stamp is definitely worth<br>
it--  Enjoy your vacation--<br>
