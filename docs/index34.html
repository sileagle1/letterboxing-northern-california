only active until October 20.

                        Some time ago, I tried to find the Rocky Trail box, only to find out it
had been pulled a while before, but they hadn't updated the clues.  Does
anyone know if it's been replaced?

Does anyone know if Tara's Where's Waldo box is still in place?  

We got this image in the fall.  At that time it was under water and
not in good shape.  We did the best we could to mend it at that...
