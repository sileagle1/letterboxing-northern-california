                        Hi,
Little Bear just planted her first box today called "Alpine Dam" in Fairfax,
Marin County. This is where she caught a Western yellow bellied racer snake
in 2002.

For anyone that might have already printed out the clues to the box I

                        We only had time for one box on Sunday but finally found one large enough to 
fit the HH we'd found a couple of weeks ago. It's somewhere in Sacramento. 
BONUS: The stamp in the box is  small but...

Raggs,
  I saw your stamp in the Sacramento City Cemetery.  Did you go on 
Saturday?  I signed in on Saturday the 8th at 8:15AM & your stamp was 
also dated 1/8.  Did I just miss you by 15 minutes? ...

                        My son asked, and I realized I had been wondering, too: why two websites on
letterboxing?

Are folks putting their clues on both sites all the time?

Confused, and hoping to spend less time on the...
