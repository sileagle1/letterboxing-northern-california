                        Just wondering if anyone out there has done the Vertigo LB?  I 
stumbled across it while reading thru the posts and puzzle types like 
this are right up my alley.  Can't wait to try this one.

                        I finally replaced Izuma which had gone MIA.  New stamp, new subject, 
new clues.  Come visit some wineries for the crush and do some 
letterboxing on the side!

Happy trails, Mimulus

                        Has anybody found "the lost oar" near Groveland? Few weeks ago we 
followed the clues, but once we got to the end, we searched and 
searched but were not able to find it(clues were pretty obvious)....
