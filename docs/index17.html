                        Hi all,

I know this is terribly last minute, since I'm still not sure if I'm 
going to be able to make it to tomorrow's shindig. I'm working on a 
paper for class, so it sort of depends on how much...

                        I probably won't know if I'll be able to attend BASS this weekend until
the day of the event.  So, what can I bring for the potluck that won't
be missed if I'm not able to show up?
